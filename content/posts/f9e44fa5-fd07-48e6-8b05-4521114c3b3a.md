内塔尼亚胡敦促美国在加沙战争抗议中支持以色列

**摘要:** 
以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡（Benjamin Netanyahu）在向美国国会联席会议发表讲话时，为以色列在加沙的战争进行了强有力的辩护，这番讲话受到了一些民主党政客的抵制。他敦促美国和以色列联合起来，共同对抗他们的共同敌人，强调当他们团结一致时，两国都会取得胜利。内塔尼亚胡表达了他对战后加沙治理的愿景，呼吁建立一个非军事化、去激进化的地区，由不寻求摧毁以色列的巴勒斯坦人进行民事管理。

美国支持的六月份宣布的三阶段停火协议仍在与哈马斯谈判中，以确保在冲突期间被扣为人质的以色列人质获释。尽管内塔尼亚胡和乔·拜登（Joe Biden）关系紧张，但总理感谢了前总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的友谊以及现任美国领导人的支持。

**要点:**
- 由于围绕以色列在加沙的战争而产生的争议，一些民主党政客抵制了内塔尼亚胡向国会的讲话。
- 以色列总理呼吁美国和以色列团结一致，强调当他们联合起来对抗共同敌人时，胜利是确定的。
- 战后加沙治理应该涉及建立一个非军事化、去激进化的地区，由不寻求摧毁以色列的巴勒斯坦人进行民事管理。
- 美国支持的六月份的三阶段停火协议仍在与哈马斯谈判中，以确保在冲突期间被扣为人质的以色列人质获释。

 **Summary:** 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a robust defense of Israel's war in Gaza during his address to a joint session of the US Congress, which was boycotted by several Democratic politicians. He urged America and Israel to stand together against their common enemies, emphasizing that when they unite, victory is assured for both nations. Netanyahu expressed his vision for postwar governance in Gaza, calling for a demilitarized and deradicalized region under civilian administration run by Palestinians who do not seek Israel's destruction.

The US-backed three-stage ceasefire deal announced in June is still being negotiated with Hamas to secure the release of Israeli hostages held captive during the conflict. Despite strained relations between Netanyahu and Joe Biden, the Prime Minister thanked both former President Donald Trump for his friendship and current US leadership for their support.
