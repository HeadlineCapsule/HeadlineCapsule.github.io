“硬起来”：拜登团队试图消除民主党内怀疑者的疑虑

一些民主党人，如乔恩·特斯特和谢罗德·布朗，对拜登总统是否能再领导四年表示怀疑。然而，其他人，如亚历山德里娅·奥卡西奥-科尔特斯和史蒂文·霍斯福德，则表达了对拜登候选资格的支持。

一些党派成员质疑拜登的身体和精神健康状况，但白宫新闻秘书卡琳·让-皮埃尔否认他有任何与帕金森病相关的治疗或药物。总统的医生也确认，最近的一次年度体检没有发现帕金森病的迹象。

虽然像罗杰·霍希尔德这样的民主党捐助者和权力经纪人仍然支持拜登，但其他人建议他为了国家的利益而退一步，或者将棒传递给其他潜在候选人，如格雷琴·惠特默、乔什·夏皮罗或卡玛拉·哈里斯。

最终，查克·舒默对支持乔·拜登的立场可能在决定他在党内的未来以及他是否会在2024年竞选连任方面发挥重要作用。

 The passage primarily focuses on the debate within the Democratic Party regarding President Biden's potential re-election bid in 2024. Some Democrats, such as Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown, express skepticamo about his ability to lead for another four years. However, others like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Steven Horsford voice their support for Biden's candidacy.

Biden's physical and mental fitness have been questioned by some party members, but the White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denies any treatment or medication related to Parkinson's disease. The president's physician also confirms that there are no signs of Parkinson's after a recent annual checkup.

While some Democratic donors and powerbrokers, like Roger Hochschild, remain supportive of Biden, others suggest he should step aside for the sake of the country or pass the baton to other potential candidates such as Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, or Kamala Harris.

Ultimately, Chuck Schumer's stance on supporting Joe Biden may play a significant role in determining his future within the party and whether he will run for re-election in 2024.
