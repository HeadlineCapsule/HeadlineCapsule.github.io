法国左翼联盟因极左暂停谈判而动荡

**法国左翼联盟因极左翼暂停谈判而陷入混乱**

法国左翼联盟中的极左翼派别“流行阵线”（NFP）因未能就总理候选人达成一致而暂停与合作伙伴的谈判。这一发展使左翼利用其在议会选举中获胜的努力陷入混乱。

NFP 包括“不屈法国”、“绿党”以及更温和的“社会党”和“共产党”。该联盟旨在通过提名总理并组建政府来发扬他们的选举成功。然而，由于在候选人选择上存在分歧，该集团内部出现了争端，这危及了他们就新国民议会主席的竞争对手达成一致的努力，而国民议会将于本周四首次召开会议。

由反资本主义者让-吕克·梅朗雄领导的“不屈法国”宣布，在为国民议会议长找到单一候选人并对其进行投票之前，他们将不会参与进一步的讨论。该党指责社会党造成了僵局，称他们不会返回直到社会党放弃对任何非自己候选人的否决权。

NFP 联盟在上个月由总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙触发的一次不期中议会选举中赢得了最多的席位，但远未获得多数席位。虽然一些政党建议为总理提出“来自民间社会的团结候选人”，但“不屈法国”拒绝了这一想法。本周末，关于 Huguette Bello 担任总理的建议遇到了困难。

左翼联盟内部的争端可能有利于马克龙的温和派联盟“在一起”，该联盟在国民议会中拥有第二大席位集团，仅次于玛丽娜·勒庞的极右翼“全国集会”。“在一起”的一些成员批评左翼缺乏单独执政的准备，并指出他们在 2022 年拥有 250 个席位时不被认定为合法。

马克龙的“在一起”联盟内部也存在分歧，分歧点在于潜在的合作伙伴和总理候选人。该集团内的强大人物正在争夺位置，并推动竞争性的联盟组建愿景，而总理加布里埃尔·阿塔、内政部长杰拉德·达曼宁和马克龙密友朱利安·德诺曼迪则争夺着影响力。

总之，由于极左翼暂停谈判，法国左翼联盟因总理候选人选择上的分歧而陷入混乱。这种内讧可能有利于埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的温和派联盟“在一起”，并可能影响法国政府未来的联盟组建。

 **France's Leftist Alliance Faces Disarray as Far-Left Suspends Negotiations**

The far-left faction of France's leftist alliance, Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP), has suspended talks with its partners following a failure to agree on a candidate for prime minister. This development plunges the left's efforts to capitalize on their victory in parliamentary elections into disarray.

The NFP includes La France Insoumise, the Greens, and more moderate Socialist and Communist parties. The alliance aimed to build on its election success by naming a prime minister and forming a government. However, disagreements over candidate selection have led to acrimony within the group, jeopardizing efforts to agree on a contender for president of the new national assembly when it convenes for the first time this Thursday.

La France Insoumise, led by anti-capitalist firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon, announced that they would not participate in further discussions until a single candidacy for the National Assembly president has been found and voted upon. The party blamed the Socialists for the impasse, stating it will not return until the Socialist Party renounces its veto on any candidate other than their own.

The NFP alliance won the most seats in the snap parliamentary elections triggered by President Emmanuel Macron last month but remains far short of a majority. While some parties have suggested fielding "a unity candidate from civil society" for prime minister, La France Insoumise has rejected this idea. The suggestion that Huguette Bello could be prime minister ran into difficulties over the weekend.

The infighting within the leftist alliance may play into Macron's hands and his centrist Ensemble alliance, which holds the second-largest bloc of seats in the assembly ahead of Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National. Some members of Ensemble have criticized the left for their lack of readiness to govern alone, pointing out that they were not considered legitimate when they held 250 seats in 2022.

Divisions also exist within Macron's Ensemble alliance over potential partners and prime ministerial candidates. Powerful figures within the group are jockeying for position and pushing competing visions for coalition formation, while Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, interior minister Gérald Darmanin, and Macron confidant Julien Denormandie vie for influence.

In summary, France's leftist alliance faces disarray as the far-left suspends negotiations over disagreements on prime ministerial candidate selection. This infighting may benefit President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance and could impact future coalition formation within the French government.
