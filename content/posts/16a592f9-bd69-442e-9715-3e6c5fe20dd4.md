台湾瞄准朝鲜走私石油

# 台湾打击北韩走私石油的努力

台湾政府旨在通过修订《打击恐怖主义融资法》来加强其措施，以防止从其港口向北韩走私石油。拟议的更改将刑事定罪与受联合国制裁的国家的公民或实体进行的交易，以及在其领土范围内进行的交易。

## 要点：

1. **对《打击恐怖主义融资法》的修订** - 台湾计划通过不仅针对直接销售，而且还针对与受制裁国家个人或实体的交易以及在其领土范围内进行的交易来扩大其法律框架。这一举措旨在堵塞法律中的现有漏洞，这些漏洞允许向北韩走私石油，破坏了自2017年以来实施的国际制裁。

2. **台湾与西方国家的关系** - 这个岛国因为未能阻止台湾和北韩之间的非法贸易而受到西方国家的批评。作为对抗中国侵略的一部分，台湾寻求支持，与坚持基于规则的国际秩序的民主国家站在一起。

3. **执法挑战** - 尽管提出了这些修订案，但过去的执法工作一直很缓慢，而且经常由于缺乏证据或证明与受制裁实体故意交易的证据不足而未能成功。自2017年以来，台湾检察官只对石油转运进行了约20项调查，导致只有一项有罪判决。

4. **俄朝石油贸易的影响** - 俄罗斯恢复向北韩直接交付石油减少了台湾供应在走私行动中的作用。然而，涉及台湾港口船只的一些活动仍在继续。

5. **潜在的抵抗和未来步骤** - 《打击恐怖主义融资法》的修订可能会在两个月的咨询期间受到船东们的反对，并在反对派控制的议会中遇到阻力。此外，还提出了对《船舶法》的修订，以加强对参与国际交易的台湾船只的监督。

总之，台湾正在采取措施，通过扩大刑事行为的范围并堵塞现有漏洞来加强其法律框架，打击向北韩走私石油的行为。然而，在执法方面仍然存在挑战，利益相关者的潜在抵制可能会阻碍这些努力。

 **Taiwan's Efforts to Combat North Korean Oil Smuggling**

The Taiwanese government aims to strengthen its measures against oil smuggling from its ports to North Korea by amending the Counter-Terrorism Financing Act. The proposed changes would criminalize transactions with citizens or entities in countries under UN sanctions, as well as those conducted within such territories.

**Key Points:**

1. **Amendments to the Counter-Terrorism Financing Act** - Taiwan plans to broaden its legal framework by targeting not only direct sales but also transactions with individuals or entities from sanctioned countries and those carried out within their territories. This move aims to close existing loopholes in the law that have allowed oil smuggling to North Korea, undermining international sanctions imposed since 2017.
   
2. **Taiwan's Relations with Western Countries** - The island nation has faced criticism from western countries for its failure to prevent illicit trade between Taiwan and North Korea. As part of its efforts to counter China's aggression, Taiwan seeks support by aligning itself with like-minded democracies that uphold the rules-based international order.
   
3. **Challenges in Enforcement** - Despite these proposed amendments, past enforcement has been slow and often unsuccessful due to a lack of evidence or insufficient proof of intentional transactions with sanctioned entities. Taiwan's prosecutors have opened only about 20 investigations into oil transshipments since 2017, resulting in just one guilty verdict.
   
4. **Impact of Russia-North Korea Oil Trade** - The resumption of direct oil deliveries from Russia to North Korea has reduced the role of Taiwanese supplies in smuggling operations. However, some activity involving vessels out of Taiwan ports continues.
   
5. **Potential Resistance and Future Steps** - Amendments to the Counter-Terrorism Financing Act may face opposition from shipowners during a two-month consultation period and could encounter resistance in the opposition-controlled parliament. Additionally, amendments to the Law of Ships have been proposed to enhance oversight of Taiwanese vessels involved in international transactions.
   
In summary, Taiwan is taking steps to strengthen its legal framework against oil smuggling to North Korea by broadening the scope of criminal behavior and closing existing loopholes. However, challenges remain in enforcement and potential resistance from stakeholders may hinder these efforts.
