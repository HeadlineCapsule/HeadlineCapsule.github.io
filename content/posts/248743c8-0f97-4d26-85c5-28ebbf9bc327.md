比亚迪与土耳其签署协议，投资10亿美元建设电动汽车工厂

**比亚迪10亿美元电动汽车工厂项目落地土耳其**

中国汽车制造商比亚迪，继特斯拉之后全球第二大电动汽车（EV）制造商，已同意在土耳其投资10亿美元建设电动汽车工厂。这一举措是比亚迪在欧洲扩大生产和继续海外扩张战略的一部分，同时也应对了欧盟收紧中国进口车准入的政策。

新工厂将拥有每年生产15万辆汽车的能力，预计将于2026年底前投产。该工厂在土耳其的建立将创造约5000个就业机会，同时开拓广阔的欧盟市场。

土耳其最近对所有中国进口汽车征收了额外的40%关税，并是欧盟海关联盟的一部分，允许向欧盟出口的汽车免除额外关税。该国的汽车工业包括现代、丰田、雷诺和福特等外国企业的合资公司。

瑞银（UBS）分析师指出，在欧洲当地生产可能是欧盟对中国汽车征收关税的“可能后果”。出于这一原因，比亚迪已投资匈牙利工厂。新土耳其工厂将生产电动和混合动力汽车，并设有研发中心。

 **BYD's $1bn Electric Vehicle Plant Deal in Turkey**

Chinese carmaker BYD, the world's second-largebest electric vehicle (EV) maker after Tesla, has agreed to a $1 billion deal for constructing an EV plant in Turkey. This move is part of their strategy to expand production within Europe and continue overseas expansion amidst Brussels clamping down on access for China imports.

The new facility will have the capacity to produce 150,000 vehicles annually and is expected to commence operations by the end of 2026. The plant's establishment in Turkey aims to create approximately 5,000 jobs while tapping into the large EU market.

Turkey has recently imposed an additional 40% tariff on all Chinese vehicle imports and is part of the EU’s Customs Union, allowing vehicles exported to the bloc without extra duties. The country's automotive industry includes foreign groups such as Hyundai, Toyota, Renault, and Ford operating through joint ventures.

Analysts at UBS have noted that local production in Europe is a "possible consequence" of EU tariffs on Chinese cars. BYD has already invested in a plant in Hungary for this reason. The new Turkish plant will produce electric and hybrid vehicles, along with a research and development center.
