更多富时100指数成分股公司寻求获取养老金盈余

# 英国上市公司释放养老基金结余的新趋势

英国上市公司越来越倾向于通过**运行**其**定义福利（DB）养老金计划来获取积累的顺差，而不是选择保险公司的买断方案。这种转变是由计划资金地位的显著改善驱动的，因为债券收益率上升和负债减少。截至今年5月，私营部门的DB养老金计划的约90%处于顺差状态，总顺差约为4690亿英镑。

## 关键要点：
- FTSE上市的公司正在越来越多地考虑“运行”他们的定义福利（DB）养老金计划，以获取积累的顺差，而不是选择保险公司的买断。
- 由于债券收益率上升和负债减少，计划资金地位得到显著改善，促使雇主重新考虑传统的买断策略。
- 截至今年5月，私营部门的DB养老金计划的约90%处于顺差状态，总顺差约为4690亿英镑。
- Aon正在与其员工协商，利用其DB计划的大额顺差来资助其定义贡献（DC）退休计划的缴费费用。
- 顺差提取仍然是受托人和计划之间的一个热门话题，但雇主正在等待新当选的工党政府进一步指示，然后再决定对顺差使用的立场。

## 重要概念：
- **定义福利计划**向成员承诺有保障的退休金，曾经是英国私营部门的常见做法。
- 由于计划资金地位的改善，雇主们正在考虑“运行”DB计划，而不是选择保险公司的买断。
- 顺差提取是一种策略，允许公司使用他们的DB计划的顺差，但它需要受托人的同意，并且可能不需要新的立法。
- 工党政府对顺差提取的立场将影响雇主关于利用养老基金结余的决定。

 **Summary:** 
A growing trend among FTSE-listed companies in the UK involves unlocking pension fund surpluses, as opposed to traditional buyout plans with insurers. This shift has been driven by a significant improvement in scheme funding positions due to increased bond yields and reduced liabilities. As of May this year, approximately 90% of private sector DB pension schemes are in surplus, totaling around £469bn.

**Key Points:**
- FTSE-listed companies are increasingly considering "running on" their defined benefit (DB) pension plans to access accrued surpluses instead of opting for insurer buyouts.
- Improved scheme funding positions, driven by increased bond yields and reduced liabilities, have led employers to reconsider traditional buyout strategies.
- Around 90% of private sector DB pension schemes are in surplus as of May this year, with a total aggregate surplus of £46amoeba.
- Aon is consulting staff on using its DB plan's substantial surplus to fund contributions costs for its defined contribution (DC) retirement plan.
- Surplus extraction remains a hot topic among trustees and schemes, but employers are awaiting further direction from the newly elected Labour government before deciding their position on surplus use.

**Important Concepts:**
- **Defined benefit plans** promise guaranteed retirement payouts to members and were once common in the UK private sector.
- The recent improvement in scheme funding positions has led employers to consider "running on" DB schemes instead of opting for insurer buyouts.
- Surplus extraction is a strategy that allows companies to use their DB plan's surplus, but it requires trustee agreement and may not require new legislation.
- The Labour government's stance on surplus extraction will influence employers' decisions regarding the utilization of pension fund surpluses.
