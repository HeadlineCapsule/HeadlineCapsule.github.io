中国传音被高通和飞利浦起诉，知识产权纠纷不断

# 中国的传音控股面临来自高通和飞利浦的知识产权挑战

**中国传音** 面临着高通和飞利浦等公司的法律挑战，被指控侵犯知识产权。这家深圳上市的公司是非洲智能手机市场的主要玩家，占据了 48% 的市场份额，现在正受到美国和欧洲科技巨头起诉专利侵权的诉讼。

**高通** 在印度、欧洲和中国对传音提起诉讼，而 **飞利浦** 也在印度发起了法律行动。诺基亚正在向这家中国公司施压，要求其支付使用其专利技术的许可费。高通首席律师安·查普林表示，他们正在寻求诉讼以保护他们的权利，并在许可方之间恢复公平竞争的环境。

传音采用了一种激进的低成本商业模式，以 110-120 美元的价格出售智能手机，平均价格为 110-120 美元。该公司声称尊重第三方知识产权，并愿意与专利持有人谈判许可协议。

传音已与高通签署了 5G 标准专利许可协议，但争议仍未解决。今年早些时候，飞利浦在印度对传音提起知识产权诉讼。中国媒体报道称，华为也在中国对传音提起诉讼，指控其侵犯知识产权。

传音正在扩大到拥有更强有力的专利执行制度的富裕消费者市场，例如欧洲和中东的部分地区。根据市场研究公司 Canalys 的数据，该公司 2024 年第一季度的年增长率高达 194%。

总之，随着传音在全球南部扩大其市场份额，它面临着来自高通和飞利浦等西方公司的知识产权问题。该公司低成本的商业模式导致了专利侵权的法律挑战，传音与多家科技巨头之间的纠纷仍在继续。

 **China's Transsion** faces legal challenges from Qualcomm and Philips over alleged intellectual property (IP) violations. The Shenzhen-listed company, a major player in the African smartphone market with 48% share, is being sued by both US and European tech giants for patent infringements.

**Qualcomm** has filed lawsuits against Transsion in India, Europe, and China, while **Philips** also initiated legal action in India. Nokia is pressuring the Chinese company to pay royalties for using its patented technologies. Qualcomm's general counsel, Ann Chaplin, stated that they are pursuing litigation to protect their rights and restore a level playing field among licensees.

Transsion has adopted an aggressive low-cost business model, selling smartphones at $110-12amoons for the average price of $110-120. The company claims it respects third-party IP rights and is willing to negotiate licensing agreements with patent holders.

Transsion has signed a 5G standard patent license agreement with Qualcomm, but disputes remain unresolved. Philips filed an IP lawsuit against Transsion in India earlier this year. Chinese media reports suggest that Huawei also launched legal action against Transsion for alleged IP violations in China back in 2

Transsion is expanding into more affluent consumer segments with stronger patent enforcement regimes, such as parts of Europe and the Middle East. The company's growth rate was reported at a staggering 194% year-on-year in Q1 2024 by research firm Canalys.

In summary, Transsion is facing mounting IP woes from Western companies like Qualcomm and Philips as it expands its market share across the global south. The company's low-cost business model has led to legal challenges over patent infringements, with ongoing disputes between Transsion and various tech giants.
