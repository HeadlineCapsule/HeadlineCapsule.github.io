美国表示不会重开加沙临时援助码头

**美国终止加沙临时援助码头项目**

美国宣布终止一项旨在向被围困的加沙地带提供人道主义援助的倡议。今年早些时候，在以色列入侵该地区导致饥荒之后，搭建的临时码头因天气恶劣和技术问题而多次中断。

**背景**：

美国安装的码头是美国努力解决加沙平民广泛饥荒的一部分，此前联合国警告说，以色列对哈马斯的战争以及对进入加沙地带的援助卡车实施限制。该项目是由美国总统乔·拜登在3月国情咨文演讲中宣布的，当时他受到强烈批评，因为美国支持以色列对加沙的战争。该项目旨在通过地中海的一个临时码头提供人道主义援助。

**挑战与关闭**：

自5月17日完工以来，该海上设施因恶劣天气多次中断，巨浪三次停止运营。美国官员将项目终止归咎于“技术和天气原因”，并表示计划在相对较短的时间内逐步停止码头运营。

**所提供援助**：

在其关闭之前，该临时援助码头提供了超过8100公吨的人道主义援助——相当于约500-600辆卡车的援助总量。这比加沙战前每天约500辆卡车的援助数量大幅减少。

**当前局势**：

美国国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文表示，由于进入加沙的援助不再是导致饥荒的主要挑战，因此该码头不再需要。相反，他强调了有效地在加沙分发援助的重要性。尽管受到批评且运营时间有限，但美国官员认为，任何能够让更多食物和人道主义物资到达加沙人民手中的结果都是成功的。

**结论**：

由于技术问题和恶劣天气，加沙临时援助码头项目已终止。尽管未能达到最初目标，但美国官员认为，为面临饥荒的平民提供任何援助都是有益的。

 **US ends makeshift aid pier project in Gaza**  
The United States has announced its decision to terminate an initiative aimed at delivering humanitarian assistance to the besieged Gaza Strip. The makeshift pier, installed earlier this year as a response to famine conditions following Israel's invasion of the enclave, faced multiple disruptions due to adverse weather and technical issues.

**Background:**  
The US-installed pier was part of an effort to alleviate widespread starvation across Gaza's civilian population after warnings from the UN about Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza and restrictions on trucked aid supplies into the strip. The project, announced by President Joe Biden during his March State of the Union address amid intense criticism for support to Israel's war in Gaza, aimed at delivering humanitarian aid via a makeshift pier in the Mediterranean Sea.

**Challenges and Closure:**  
The marine facility faced multiple disruptions due to bad weather since its completion on May 17, with waves halting operations three times. US officials cited "technical and weather-related issues" as reasons for the project's termination, stating that they plan to wind down pier operations in relatively short order.

**Aid Delivered:**  
Despebefore its closure, the makeshift aid pier delivered more than 8,100 metric tonnes of humanitarian assistance - equivalent to about 500-600 truckloads of aid in total. This was a significant reduction from Gaza's pre-war daily intake of approximately 500 trucks of aid.

**Current Situation:**  
US national security adviser Jake Sullivan stated that the pier is no longer needed, as getting aid into Gaza is not the main challenge for those facing famine conditions. Instead, he emphasized the importance of effectively distributing aid around Gaza. Despite criticisms and limited operational time, US officials view any result that produces more food and humanitarian goods reaching the people of Gaza as a success.

**Conclusion:**  
The makeshift aid pier project in Gaza has been terminated due to technical issues and adverse weather conditions. While it fell short of its initial goals, US officials consider any assistance delivered to be beneficial for the civilian population facing famine conditions.
