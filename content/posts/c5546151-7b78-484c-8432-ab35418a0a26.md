美联储官员表示，随着通胀降温，降息“越来越近”

# 两位美国利率制定者支持未来降息

**摘要：**
克里斯托弗·沃勒（Christopher Waller）和约翰·威廉姆斯（Johnn Williams）两位有影响力的美联储官员表示，由于通货膨胀数据好转以及劳动力市场降温的迹象，他们支持未来几个月可能降息。尽管美国总统唐纳德·特朗普反对这一举措，认为这将有利于他的竞争对手乔·拜登，但这些官员建议很快可能会降息。

**要点：**
- **克里斯托弗·沃勒**（美联储理事）和**约翰·威廉姆斯**（纽约联储主席）支持未来不久降息。
- 通货膨胀数据好转以及劳动力市场降温的迹象推动了这一观点。
- 自2018年7月以来，美联储一直将基准政策利率保持在5.25-5.5%不变。
- 投资者预计在年底前会出现两次降息，将利率接近其2%的通货膨胀目标。
- 一次可能的降息可能发生在9月中旬的美联储投票中，这恰好是在11月总统大选之前。
- 特朗普总统警告说，选举前的降息会有利于他的竞争对手乔·拜登。
- 沃勒和威廉姆斯都强调需要进一步的证据才能批准降息。
- 劳动力市场的降温被视为对失业率的好处，官员们旨在维持当前的“甜蜜点”。
- 通货紧缩过程中的任何中断都可能推迟可能的利率削减。

 **Summary:**
Two influential US rate-setters, Christopher Waller and Johnn Williams, have signaled their support for potential interest rate cuts in the coming months due to improved inflation data and signs that the labor market is cooling off. Despite opposition from President Donald Trump, who believes a pre-election shift would benefit his rival Joe Biden, these officials suggest that rate cuts may be appropriate soon.

**Key Points:**
- **Christopher Waller** (Federal Reserve governor) and **John Williams** (New York Fed president) support potential interest rate cuts in the near future.
- Improved inflation data and signs of a cooling labor market are driving this sentiment.
- The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged since July 2018 at 5.25-5.5%.
- Investors expect two quarter-point cuts before the end of ebyte, bringing rates closer to their 2% inflation goal.
- One potential rate cut could occur at the Fed's mid-September vote, just before the November presidential election.
- President Trump has warned against pre-election rate cuts, stating they would benefit his rival Joe Biden.
- Both Waller and Williams emphasize the need for further evidence before approving a rate reduction.
- The labor market's softening is seen as an upside risk to unemployment, with officials aiming to maintain its current "sweet spot."
- Any disruptions in the disinflation process could delay potential interest rate cuts.
