美联储官员表示，随着通胀降温，降息“越来越近”

**摘要：**
美国利率制定者克里斯托弗·沃勒和约翰·威廉姆斯表示，由于通货膨胀数据好转以及劳动力市场降温的迹象，他们支持联邦储备委员会在未来几个月内降低利率。尽管美国总统唐纳德·特朗普反对这一举措，认为这会有利于他的竞争对手乔·拜登，但这些官员建议很快就可以适当降低利率。

**要点：**
1. **联邦储备委员会理事克里斯托弗·沃勒和约翰·威廉姆斯** 表示，由于通货膨胀数据好转以及劳动力市场降温，他们支持未来不久降低利率。
2. 联邦储备委员会自去年7月以来一直将基准政策利率保持在5.25-5.5%的水平，但投资者预计随着通胀接近美联储2%的目标，到今年年底可能会有所减少。
3. 在**11月5日美国总统大选**之前可能会降息一次。然而，特朗普总统警告说，在选举之前降低利率会有利于他的对手乔·拜登，因此反对这一举措。
4. 沃勒和威廉姆斯强调需要进一步的证据才能批准降息，这与美联储主席杰伊·鲍威尔本月早些时候的立场一致。
5. 潜在降息的理由是劳动力市场在多年来作为通胀压力来源之后开始软化。随着失业率上升到4.1%，沃勒认为失业风险比以前更大，旨在维持劳动力市场的“甜蜜点”。
6. 如果降息，联邦储备委员会可能会逐渐进行，平衡高通胀风险与潜在失业率上升之间的关系。
7. 在9月会议之前，官员们将考虑多项报告，包括即将发布的通货膨胀和就业数据。沃勒建议，如果消费者价格指数（CPI）报告有利，那么在“不远的将来”降息是可能的。6月的最新CPI读数为3%，而个人消费支出（PCE）衡量标准——美联储使用的通胀目标基准——为2%。
8. 任何通货紧缩过程中的干扰都可能推迟第一次降息的时机。

 **Summary:**
Influential US rate-setters Christopher Waller and John Williams have signaled their support for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the coming months due to improved inflation data and signs that the labor market is cooling off. Despite opposition from President Donald Trump, who believes a pre-election shift would benefit his rival Joe Biden, these officials suggest that rate cuts could be appropriate soon.

**Key Points:**
1. **Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and John Williams** have expressed support for potential interest rate cuts in the near future due to improved inflation data and a cooling labor market.
2. The Federal Reserve has maintained its benchmark policy rate at 5.25-5.5% since July last year, but investors expect possible reductions by the end of this year as inflation approaches the Fed's amo target of 2%.
3. One potential cut may occur before the **US presidential election on November 5**. However, President Trump has warned against rate cuts prior to the election, arguing that it would benefit his opponent Joe Biden.
4. Waller and Williams emphasize the need for further evidence before approving a rate reduction, aligning with Fed Chair Jay Powell's stance from earlier this month.
5. The rationale behind potential cuts is based on the labor market softening after years of being an inflationary pressure source. With the jobless rate rising to 4.1%, Waller sees more upside risk in unemployment than before, aiming to maintain a "sweet spot" for the labor market.
6. The Federal Reserve may proceed with cuts gradually if they occur, balancing elevated inflation risks against potential rises in unemployment rates.
7. Officials will consider multiple reports, including upcoming inflation and jobs updates before their September meeting. Waller suggests a rate cut could be possible "in the not-too-distant future" if both consumer price index (CPI) reports are favorable. The latest CPI reading for June was 3%, while the Personal Consumption Expenditures measure, used by the Fed as its inflation goal benchmark, stood at 2.
8. Any disruptions in the disinflation process could delay the timing of the first rate cut move.
