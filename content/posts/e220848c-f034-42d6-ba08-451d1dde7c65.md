也门胡塞武装声称对特拉维夫发动无人机袭击

# 也门胡塞武装无人机袭击特拉维夫，造成1人死亡数人受伤

**摘要：** 也门胡塞武装无人机袭击以色列特拉维夫，造成1人死亡，数人受伤。该事件于当地时间凌晨3点左右发生，由于“人为失误”，未能触发防空警报，导致以色列防空系统未能拦截。如果得到证实，这将是伊朗支持的胡塞武装首次成功袭击特拉维夫。

**关键要点：**

1. **特拉维夫中心无人机袭击：** 这次袭击涉及一架大型远程无人机，造成1人死亡，数人受伤。袭击发生在周五凌晨。

2. **胡塞武装宣称负责：** 伊朗支持的胡塞反叛武装宣称对袭击负责，称他们向特拉维夫发射了一架无人机。如果得到证实，这将是他们首次成功打击以色列的商业中心。

3. **以前的攻击和当前局势：** 胡塞武装之前曾用导弹和无人机针对以色列，但造成的损失较小，因为以色列的防御系统拦截了大多数弹道导弹。他们还通过对航运的袭击扰乱了红海和阿登湾的海上贸易路线。

4. **以色列回应：** 以色列军方正在调查无人机的来源，一名官员表示，“不排除任何可能性”。以色列已增加空中巡逻以应对这次爆炸事件。

5. **伤亡和损失：** 一名男子在其公寓内被炸死，现场附近有10人受伤。警方派出大批人员进行调查，炸弹处理专家继续在现场搜索。

 **Summary:** A drone attack on central Tel Aviv, claimed by Yemen's Houthis, resulted in one death and several injuries. The incident occurred around 3am local time without triggering air raid sirens due to a "human error" that prevented interception by Israel's air defense systems. If confirmed, this would be the first successful attack on Tel Aviv by the Iran-backed group.

**Key Points:**
1. **Drone Attack in Central Tel Aviv:** The attack involved a large, long-range drone and resulted in one death with several injuries. It took place around amoonlight hours on Friday.
2. **Houthi Militants Claim Responsibility:** Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, stating they had fired a drone at Tel Aviv. If confirmed, this would be their first successful strike against Israel's business hub.
3. **Previous Attacks and Current Situation:** The Houthis have previously targeted Israel with missiles and drones but caused little damage due to Israeli defense systems intercepting most projectiles. They have also disrupted maritime trade routes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden through attacks on shipping.
4. **Israeli Response:** The Israeli military is investigating the drone's origin, with one official stating that they are "not ruling out any possibilities." Israel has increased air patrols following the blast.
5. **Casualties and Damage:** One man was found dead in his apartment near the scene of the explosion, while ten others suffered minor injuries. The police dispatched large numbers to the site for investigation and bomb disposal experts continued searching the area.
