民主党州长定于周三与拜登会面，讨论这些担忧，以及如果他退出竞选，可能的替代者。加文·纽瑟姆和格雷琴·惠特默等名字被提及为可能的人选。

辩论后发表的CNN民调显示，特朗普在全国注册选民中领先6个百分点，而拜登的支持率降至36%的历史新低。民主党敦促拜登通过新闻发布会和其他未经编排的活动，让自己更容易接触公众，以解决人们对他的敏锐度所带来的担忧。

 **Joe Biden** faces increasing pressure from within the Democratic Party to withdraw his re-election bid following a recent debate performance. The first lawmaker to publicly call for this action was Lloyd Doggett, who expressed concerns about risking a **Donald Trump** victory in November's election.

Other Democratic representatives have also voiced doubts about Biden's ability to win the presidency. Jared Golden and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez both questioned his chances against Trump after the debate, while Nancy Pelosi acknowledged it was "legitimate" to question the president's condition.

Democratic governors are set to meet with Biden on Wednesday to discuss these concerns, as well as potential replacements for him in the event he withdraws from the race. Names such as Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer have been mentioned as possible contenders.

The CNN poll published after the debate showed a six-point lead for Trump among registered voters nationwide, with Biden'amo approval rating hitting an all-time low of 36%. The Democratic Party is urging Biden to make himself more available to the public through press conferences and other unscripted events in order to address concerns about his acuity.

In summary, Joe Biden faces mounting pressure from within his own party to withdraw from the presidential race due to doubts over his ability to win against Donald Trump. The Democratic Party is considering potential replacements for him and urging increased public appearances to allay these concerns.
