瑞科特被股东敦促重新考虑出售营养品业务

雷克特（Reckitt）受到主要股东的压力，要求其重新考虑出售营养业务，此前该部门遭遇了一系列挫折和诉讼。该公司股价因米德约翰逊（Mead Johnson）婴儿配方奶粉业务中的失误而跌至十年低点，该业务于2017年以170亿美元的价格收购。

**要点：**

* 雷克特的营养业务约占其收入的15%，规模远小于其较大的卫生和健康部门。
*该公司一直受到婴儿配方奶粉死亡案件的困扰，分析师估计总赔偿责任在4亿至80亿美元之间。
* 股东敦促雷克特重新考虑分拆公司卫生和健康部门的计划，或考虑出售营养业务。
* 该综合企业定于周三公布半年报。

**股东观点：**

Flossbach von Storch投资组合经理Simon Jäger表示，雷克特已经确定营养业务不适合其未来，出售该业务可以为投资者提供确定性。

Causeway Capital Management的Ellen Lee建议，在诉讼 kết thúc之前，将米德约翰逊置于保护公司其他部门的“隔离墙”之内可能是一个选择。

**雷克特的回应：**

该公司拒绝了婴儿配方奶粉死亡案件的判决，并认为该判决没有科学依据。

雷克特表示，该公司致力于执行最大化股东价值的战略，包括创造投资组合价值的三项原则。

**Reckitt Under Pressure from Shareholders to Revamp Nutrition Business**

The FTSE 100 consumer giant Reckitt is facing pressure from top shareholders to revisit a sale of its nutrition business, following a series of setbacks and litigation at the division. The company's share price has hit decade lows due to mishaps in the Mead Johnson infant formula business, which was acquired for $17bn in 2017.

**Key Points:**

* Reckitt's nutrition business makes up about 15% of its revenues and is a fraction of the size of its larger hygiene and health divisions.
* The company has been plagued by litigation over baby formula deaths, with analysts estimating total liability between £400mn and £8bn.
* Shareholders are urging Reckitt to revisit plans to separate out the company's hygiene and health divisions, or consider selling the nutrition business.
* The conglomerate is due to report its half-year results on Wednesday.

**Shareholder Views:**

* Flossbach von Storch portfolio manager Simon Jäger said Reckitt has identified the nutrition business as one that doesn't fit into their future, and a sale could provide certainty for investors.
* Causeway Capital Management's Ellen Lee suggested that ringfencing Mead Johnson to protect the rest of the company until litigation is concluded might be an option.

**Reckitt's Response:**

* The company has rejected the verdict in the baby formula death case and argued it has no scientific basis.
* Reckitt said it is committed to executing its strategy to maximize value for shareholders, including three principles for portfolio value creation.
