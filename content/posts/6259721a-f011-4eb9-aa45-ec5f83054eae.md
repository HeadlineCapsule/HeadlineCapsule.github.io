亚马逊国际部门有望实现年度盈利

# Amazon 的国际部门年度利润目标

亚马逊的国际部门预计将在德国和英国等关键海外市场重新组织仓库和交付运营后实现年度利润，从而实现更快的送货速度和更便宜的当地运营。根据 Refinitiv 最近的一项调查中的分析师预测，该部门今年将报告 16 亿美元的经营利润，明年将上升至超过 50 亿美元。

这家科技巨头的国际部门去年报告了 27 亿美元的经营亏损，但在 2024 年第一季度因精简物流运营和进入新国家而实现了盈利。亚马逊首席执行官安迪·贾西 (Andy Jassy) 表示，美国整改的经验教训将应用于国际运营，巴西等既定市场和新兴市场预计将改善表现。

亚马逊不断发展的广告业务和增加的仓库自动化也预计将推动全球电子商务利润。该公司没有披露每个海外市场的财务状况，但提到英国、日本和一些欧洲国家等成熟市场已经盈利。

投资者继续向亚马逊施加压力，要求在国际账户披露和海外税收方面更加透明。该公司继续减少送货时间，同时在全球范围内扩大其物理物流网络，包括仓库和交付中心，并计划未来几年全球新开设 49 个设施。

 **Summary:** Amazon's International Unit on Track for Annual Profit

Amazon's international arm is projected to swing into an annual profit after reorganizing warehouses and delivery operations across key overseas markets such as Germany and the UK, leading to faster deliveries and cheaper local operations. The unit is expected to report a $1.6bn operating profit this year, rising to more than $5bn next year according to analysts in a recent Refinitiv poll.

The tech giant's international segment posted an operating loss of $2.7bn last year but has since turned profitable during the first quarter of 2024 due to its efforts in streamlining logistics operations and launching new countries. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that lessons from the US overhaul would apply to international operations, with both established and emerging markets like Brazil expected to improve performance.

Amazon's growing advertising business and increased warehouse automation are also anticipated to contribute to global e-commerce profits. The company does not disclose financials for each overseas market but has mentioned that certain mature ones, including the UK, Japan, and some European countries, are already profitable.

Investor pressure remains on Amazon for more transparency in international accounts disclosure and tax payments overseas. The company continues to reduce delivery times amidst competition from Chinese e-commerce rivals like Temu and Shein while expanding its physical logistics network of warehouses and delivery hubs worldwide, with plans to open 49 new facilities globally in the coming years.
