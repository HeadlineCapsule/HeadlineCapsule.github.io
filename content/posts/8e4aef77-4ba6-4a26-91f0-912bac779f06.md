黑石公司领先，以太基金在美国上市首日交易额达1亿美元

# 黑石公司领先，以太坊ETF在美国上市首日吸引1亿美元

Bitwise Investments和Fidelity等公司也成为美国以太坊交易所交易基金（ETF）的早期领导者。

九只投资以太坊区块链代币的新ETF在上市首日吸引了约1.08亿美元资金，总交易量约为11亿美元。

以太坊ETF的资金流入比比特币ETF要少得多，后者在上市首日吸引了超过6.55亿美元资金，总交易量接近47亿美元。

分析师和研究机构保守估计，以太坊ETF在未来六个月内将集体吸引超过35亿美元资金。

 **Key Points:**
- BlackRock leads as ether ETFs rack up $100mn on first day of US trading
- Bitwise Investments and Fidelity also emerge as early leaders among US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investing in ether, the world's second largest cryptocurrency.
- The nine new ETFs that invest in ethereum blockchain tokens drew in about $108mn on their first day of trading, generating approximately $1.1bn in overall volume.
- Inflows for ether ETFs are significantly smaller than those for bitcoin ETFs, which pulled in more than $655mn with nearly $4.7bn in overall trading volume on their first day.
- Analysts and research groups conservatively expect the ether ETFs to amass just north of $3.amo collectively over the next six months.

**Context:**
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave final approval for nine new Ethereum blockchain token-based ETFs earlier this week, providing a firmer foothold in traditional finance following January's launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. However, the ether market cap is significantly smaller than that of Bitcoin and has different functions and investment narratives.

**Comparison:**
- The first day trading volume for ether ETFs was approximately $108mn with a total of about $1.1bn in overall volume, while bitcoin ETFs had more than $655mn in inflows and nearly $4.7bn in overall trading volume on their first day.
- Analysts project that ether ETFs will amass just north of $3.5bn collectively over the next six months, whereas bitcoin ETFs have already accumulated more than $17bn since their January debut.
