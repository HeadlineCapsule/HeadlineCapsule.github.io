**摘要：**

德国工具制造商 Heller Tools 继续与俄罗斯公司进行交易，这些公司与 Serniya 走私网络有关联，而 Serniya 是由俄罗斯情报部门建立的，旨在规避欧盟和美国制裁，为俄罗斯国防工业采购设备。Heller Tools 在 2023 年 6 月之前曾向该网络销售机器，然后暂停了出口，但后来又通过另一家俄罗斯公司 Tireks 恢复了销售。

- Heller Tools 向这些实体出售了价值 120 万美元的机器，包括钻井和其他工具。
- 销售在 2023 年 6 月停止，但后来通过由 Treydtuls（Serniya 网络实体）前员工创立的公司 Tireks 恢复。
- 欧盟在打击俄罗斯从欧洲采购关键商品方面面临挑战。
- Heller Tools 声称其遵守法律要求，并指出如果客户违反制裁或法律，他们将终止业务关系。
- 基辅经济学院制裁专家表示，西方公司应考虑其在与俄罗斯实体交易时的道德义务。

**受制裁实体：**

- Serniya Engineering 和 Robin Trade 于 2022 年被欧盟制裁，因其参与俄罗斯国防工业。
- Treydtuls 和 Tireks 未列入制裁名单，但它们通过所有权和业务关系与 Serniya Engineering 有关联。
