与间谍有关联的俄罗斯人重启与德国工具制造商的贸易

**摘要：**
台湾领导人拥有的工具制造商Heller Tools，恢复了向俄罗斯实体销售，这些实体与俄罗斯情报部门建立的秘密走私网络Serniya有关联。该网络旨在规避欧盟和美国制裁，同时为俄罗斯国防工业获取设备。尽管此前曾就此类交易发出过警告，但Heller Tools仍在2023年1月至6月期间向该网络相关公司出售了价值120万美元的机械设备。

根据美国司法部的说法，Serniya网络是由俄罗斯情报部门指导建立的，旨在规避制裁并获取国防工业设备。在2023年1月至6月期间，Heller Tools向莫斯科公司Trading House Treydtuls申报了86万美元的销售额，该公司与Serniya有关联。

海关记录显示，在《金融时报》就其与Treydtuls的贸易提出质疑后，Heller对Treydtuls的出口在2023年6月停止。然而，到9月，他们又开始向另一家俄罗斯公司Tireks出售价值30万美元的货物，该公司由之前在Treydtuls工作的人创立。

Heller Tools表示，它遵守所有法律要求，如果公司出现在制裁名单上或违反法律规定，它不会进行商业合作或交付货物。 sold to the Russian entities were added to EU export control lists in December 2023, as they could contribute to enhancing Russian industrial capacities.

基辅经济学院研究所制裁专家Olena Bilousova敦促西方公司考虑他们的道德义务，避免出售可用于战争努力的物品，即使它们不受出口管制。 《金融时报》之前发现了Treydtuls和Robin Trade之间的联系，两者都由商人Alexey Zibyrov拥有。 Serniya Engineering和Robin Trade因俄罗斯入侵乌克兰而被欧盟制裁。

你是一位国际关系和地缘政治分析领域的高级研究员。 一位学生要求你解释Heller Tools在上文所述的行动如何影响台湾与俄罗斯的关系。 在你的回答中包括至少三种对这些双边关系的潜在后果。

**答案：**
台湾工具制造商Heller Tools与俄罗斯情报部门建立的一个秘密走私网络有关联，这可能会对台湾与俄罗斯的双边关系产生多种影响。以下是三种可能的后果：

1. **紧张的外交关系：** Heller Tools向与Serniya网络相关公司出售机械设备可能会导致台湾与俄罗斯的外交关系紧张，尤其是如果这些交易违反了因乌克兰问题对俄罗斯实施的国际制裁。这可能会导致双边关系冷却，因为两国根据对国际规范和法规的遵守重新评估其关系。

2. **贸易关系的影响：** Heller Tools与俄罗斯实体的交易争议可能会影响台湾与俄罗斯的整体经济和贸易关系。如果这些销售被视为违反制裁的行为，可能会导致

 **Summary:**
Taiwan leader's toolmaker company, Heller Tools, resumed sales to Russian entities linked to a covert FSB smuggling network known as Serniya. The network was established by Russian intelligence services to evade EU and US sanctions while obtaining equipment for the Russian defense industry. Despite previous warnings about such transactions, Heller Tools sold machinery worth $1.2 million to companies associated with this network between January 2023 and June 2023.

The Serniya network was set up under the direction of Russian intelligence services to circumvent EU and US sanctions and obtain equipment for the Russian defense industry, according to the US Department of Justice. Heller Tools declared $860,000 in sales to a Moscow company called Trading House Treydtuls, which is linked to Serniya between January 2023 and June 2023.

Customs records show that Heller's exports to Treydtuls stopped in June 2023 after the Financial Times approached them with questions about their trade with Treydtuls. However, by September, they had started selling goods worth $300,000 to a different Russian firm called Tireks, which was founded by an individual previously employed by Treydtuls.

Heller Tools stated that it complied with all legal requirements and would not engage in business relationships or deliver goods if companies were on sanctions lists or violated legal requirements. The construction tools sold to the Russian entities were added to EU export control lists in December 2023, as they could contribute to enhancing Russian industrial capacities.

Olena Bilousova, a sanctions expert at Kyiv School of Economics Institute, urged western companies to consider their moral obligations and avoid selling items that can be used for the war effort, even if not export-controlled. The Financial Times previously uncovered links between Treydtuls and Robin Trade, both owned by businessman Alexey Zibyrov. Serniya Engineering and Robin Trade were sanctioned by the EU in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Tireks owner You are a senior researcher with expertise in international relations and geopolitical analysis. A student asks you to explain how the actions of Heller Tools, as described in the article above, could impact Taiwan-Russia relations. Provide an answer that includes at least three potential consequences for these bilateral relations.

**Answer:**
The involvement of Heller Tools, a toolmaker company from Taiwan, with Russian entities linked to a covert FSB smuggling network can have several implications on the bilateral relations between Taiwan and Russia. Here are three potential consequences:

1. **Strained diplomatic ties:** The sale of machinery by Heller Tools to companies associated with the Serniya network could strain diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Russia, especially if these transactions violate international sanctions imposed on Russia due to its actions in Ukraine. This may lead to a cooling off of bilateral ties as both countries reassess their relationship based on adherence to international norms and regulations.

2. **Impact on trade relations:** The controversy surrounding Heller Tools' transactions with Russian entities could have an impact on the broader economic and trade relations between Taiwan and Russia. If these sales are deemed as a violation of sanctions, it may lead to increased scrutiny by international regulatory bodies and potentially result in restrictions or penaltamoes for both countries. This could negatively affect bilateral trade volumes and investment
