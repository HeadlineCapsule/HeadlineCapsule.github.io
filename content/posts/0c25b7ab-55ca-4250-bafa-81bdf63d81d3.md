美国经济新增20.6万个工作岗位，但失业率上升

**美国劳动力市场出现降温迹象，6月失业率上升至4.1%，就业增长也下调**

美国劳动力市场出现了降温迹象，6月失业率上升至4.1%，而且最近几个月的就业增长也低于之前报告的数据。上个月经济增加了20.6万个工作岗位，超过了经济学家的预测，但修订数据显示，4月和5月的就业人数比最初报告的低了11.1万。

联邦储备委员会正在密切关注劳动力市场状况，以指导其关于何时开始降息周期的决定。该行最近发布的6月会议纪要显示，政策制定者越来越关注劳动力市场的下行风险，以及其从强势转弱的可能性。

国内就业市场走软有多方面因素造成，包括对前几个月数据的向下修正、医疗保健和政府工作岗位占比高、削减临时工以及家庭调查结果疲弱等。6月平均每小时工资同比增长3.9%，为三年来增速最慢。

周五公布的软弱就业数据后，国债收益率下降，交易员押注美联储今年可能会两次降息。两年期国债收益率一度跌破4.6%，低于周三公众假期的水平。

 **Summary:**  
US Labor Market Shows Signs of Cooling as Unemployment Rate Increases to 4.1% in June, Job Growth Revised Lower

The US labor market exhibited signs of cooling with the unemployment rate rising to 4.1% in June and recent job growth being revised lower than previously reported. The economy added 206,000 jobs last month, exceeding economists' forecast but revisions showed employment during April and May was 111,n thousand lower than initially reported.

The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the labor market conditions to guide its decision on when to commence an interest rate cutting cycle as price pressures ease. The recently released minutes of the central bank's June meeting revealed that policymakers are becoming more attentive to downside risks in the labor market and the possibility of it turning from strong to weak quickly.

Several factors contributed to a softening trend in the domestic jobs market, including downward revisions to previous months, high proportions of healthcare and government jobs, cuts to temporary workers, and a weak household survey. Average hourly earnings were up 3.9% from a year ago in June, marking the slowest pace of growth in three years.

Treasury yields dropped on Friday following the release of softer payroll data, with traders betting that this could allow the Fed to cut interest rates twice this year. The yield on the two-year Treasury briefly dipped below 4.6%, representing a drop from Wednesday's level before the public holiday.
