欧盟准备两步走计划应对特朗普

# 欧盟应对唐纳德·特朗普潜在第二个任期的两步贸易战略

欧洲联盟（EU）正在准备一项两步贸易战略，以应对唐纳德·特朗普重返白宫的可能性。这种方法涉及如果他赢得第二个总统任期，则提供快速协议；如果他选择惩罚性措施，则进行有针对性的报复。欧盟官员认为这种胡萝卜加大棒的方法是对特朗普提议的10%最低关税的有效回应，该关税可能会使欧盟出口每年减少约1500亿欧元。

## 第一步：提供快速协议
如果关于改善贸易关系的谈判失败并且提高了关税，欧洲委员会的贸易部门正在准备一份美国进口商品清单，欧盟可以对这些商品征收高达50%的关税。欧盟旨在将自己表现为美国的合作伙伴，而不是一个问题。计划包括在特朗普11月获胜之前增加某些美国产品购买量的讨论。

## 第二步：有针对性的报复
如果谈判失败并且提高了关税，欧盟准备好采取报复性措施来捍卫自己的利益。以前的情况看到布鲁塞尔对波本威士忌、哈雷戴维森摩托车和动力艇等商品征收平衡关税——所有这些都针对特朗普的核心选民。

## 过去的贸易关系：对欧盟来说是痛苦的
2017年至2021年特朗普的第一个任期对欧盟来说是具有挑战性的，因为欧盟与美国的货物贸易顺差巨大。对欧盟价值64亿欧元的钢铁和铝产品征收关税导致布鲁塞尔采取报复性措施。

## 乐观的前景：避免对抗
欧盟贸易专员瓦尔迪斯·东布罗夫斯基斯（Valdis Dombrovskis）表示，他希望避免双方过去的对抗。他强调了作为战略盟友在当前地缘政治背景下就贸易问题开展合作的必要性，并提到布鲁塞尔对减少1560亿欧元的货物贸易逆差的“有针对性的协议”持开放态度。

## 潜在影响：关税战的后果
潜在的关税战争可能会对双方的经济产生不同影响，高盛（Goldman Sachs）的Jan Hatzius预测，这将占欧盟GDP的1%，而美国则占0.5%。然而，美国和欧盟的通货膨胀率会受到不同的影响——比美国高出1.1%，比欧盟高出0.1%。

总之，欧盟正在准备一项两步贸易战略，根据特朗普在赢得第二个总统任期后的行动，要么提供协议，要么报复性征收关税。目标是保持合作的方法，同时在出现对抗时准备好捍卫自己的利益。

 **EU's Two-Step Trade Strategy for Dealing with Potential Second Term of Donald Trump**

The European Union (EU) is preparing a two-step trade strategy to address the possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House. The approach involves offering a quick deal if he wins a second term as president, and targeted retaliation against tariffs should he opt for punitive measures instead. EU officials view this carrot-and-stick method as an effective response to Trump's proposed 10% minimum tariff, which could potentially reduce EU exports by around €150 billion annually.

**First Step: Quick Deal Offering**
Should negotiations over improving trade relations fail and higher tariffs are applied, the European Commission’s trade department is preparing lists of US imports that it could target with duties as high as 50%. The EU aims to demonstrate itself as a partner for the US rather than a problem. Plans include discussions on increasing purchases of certain US products before Trump takes office if he wins in November.

**Second Step: Targeted Retaliation**
In case talks fail and higher tariffs are imposed, the EU is ready to defend its interests with retaliatory measures. Previous instances have seen Brussels imposing rebalancing tariffs on goods such as bourbon whiskey, Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and power boats - all targeted at Trump's core voters.

**Past Trade Relationship: Painful for the EU**
Trump’s first term between 2ebet2017 and 2021 was challenging for the EU, which runs a substantial goods trade surplus with the US. The introduction of tariffs on €6.4 billion worth of steel and aluminum imports from the EU led to retaliatory measures by Brussels.

**Hopeful Outlook: Avoiding Confrontation**
Valdis Dombrovskis, EU trade commissioner, expressed hope for avoiding a repeat of past confrontations between the two sides. He emphasized the importance of working together on trade as strategic allies in the current geopolitical context and mentioned that Brussels is open to "targeted deals" to reduce the €156 billion trade deficit in goods.

**Potential Impact: Tariff War Consequences**
A potential tariff war could have varying effects on both economies, with Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs forecasting that it would cost 1% of EU GDP compared to 0.5% of the US. However, inflation rates in the US and EU would be affected differently - adding 1.1% to the US rate versus only 0.1% for the EU.

In conclusion, the EU is preparing a two-step trade strategy that involves offering deals or retaliating with tariffs depending on Trump's actions if he wins a second term as president. The goal is to maintain a cooperative approach while being ready to defend its interests in case of confrontation.
