历史性的北约峰会因有关拜登的问题而蒙上阴影

北约峰会因人们担心美国总统乔·拜登的健康状况、他1月后的北约承诺以及他与唐纳德·特朗普的连任竞选而蒙上阴影。尽管存在这些不确定性，但目击者称，拜登在峰会期间看起来“非常清醒”。

拜登一度错误地将乌克兰总统沃洛德米尔·泽连斯基称为俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京，但很快纠正了自己。这一失误加剧了盟友之间的紧张气氛，他们担心拜登是否能够继续他的竞选并赢得选举。

匈牙利总理维克多·奥班将仍然相信拜登获胜的人比作在泰坦尼克号沉船时继续拉小提琴的人。然而，其他人驳斥了这种悲观情绪，指出拜登在峰会期间的官方干预中“非常清醒”且专注。

北约盟友谨慎地公开评论拜登的健康状况，以避免干涉即将举行的选举或激怒关键盟友。尽管如此，由于特朗普的反北约立场以及美国安全承诺的重要性，欧洲各国首都普遍存在焦虑情绪。

在峰会期间，拜登出人意料地向即将离任的北约秘书长延斯·斯托尔滕贝格颁发了总统自由勋章，并成功地将其挂在了他的脖子上。与会者指出，尽管拜登能够从纸上朗读准备好的讲话稿，但这对美国总统来说是一个很低的标准。

 **Summary of Article:**

The 75th anniversary NATO summit was overshadowed by concerns about US President Joe Biden's health, commitment to the alliance beyond January, and his re-election campaign against Donald Trump. Despite these uncertainties, Biden appeared "fully present" during the summit proceedings according to witnesses.

Biden mistakenly referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Russian President Vladimir Putin at one point but quickly corrected himself. This gaffe added tension to an already uneasy atmosphere among allies, who are concerned about Biden's ability to continue his campaign and win the election.

Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán compared those still believing in Biden's victory to people playing violins on the Titanic as it sank. However, others dismissed such pessimism, noting that Biden was "fully present" and focused during official interventions at the summit.

NATO allies have been cautious in making public remarks about Biden's health to avoid interfering with the upcoming election or upsetting a critical ally. Despite this, there is acute nervousness among European capitals due to Trump’s anti-NATO positions and the importance of US security pledges.

During the summit, Biden surprised outgoing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he successfully fastened around his neck. Attendees noted that while Biden was able to read prepared remarks from a paper, this is considered a low bar for a US president.

- Biden mistakenly referred to Zelenskyy as Putin but quickly corrected himself, adding tension among allies
