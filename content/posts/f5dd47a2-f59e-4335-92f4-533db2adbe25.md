麦肯锡胜诉，成功辩护了由竞争对手Jay Alix提出的勒索案。

麦肯锡在纽约法官驳回的六年诉讼中获胜

美国法官裁定驳回一项诉讼，该诉讼声称麦肯锡的破产业务是一种“犯罪企业”，违反了管理公司重组的利益冲突规则。这一决定标志着咨询公司在与转型专家杰伊·阿利克斯的法律纠纷中取得重大胜利，后者指控麦肯锡在众多破产案件中未能申报利益冲突。

杰伊·阿利克斯声称，如果指控属实，他的前公司阿利克斯合伙人将受到损害，并寻求通过反黑帮法律获得赔偿。然而，杰西·弗曼法官裁定，由于任何潜在的伤害都会影响阿利克斯的前公司，因此阿利克斯本人对麦肯锡没有有效的索赔。

驳回此案的决定是阿利克斯和他的公司持续的法律攻击的一部分，其中包括在各种破产法院提出的、可以追溯到十年前的索赔。反黑帮案件之前曾被驳回一次，但上诉后得到恢复。

麦肯锡于2020年进入重组业务领域，与阿利克斯合伙人竞争，并坚称这些指控毫无根据。在裁定之后，麦肯锡对再次驳回该案表示宽慰。弗曼的裁决基于阿利克斯没有被明确赋予阿利克斯合伙人任何反黑帮索赔的权利。

杰伊·阿利克斯的律师肖恩·奥谢不同意这一裁决，并预计将第二次提出上诉，这表明麦肯锡和阿利克斯之间的法律斗争可能还没有结束。

 **McKinsey** prevails in six-year old legal action dismissed by New York judge

A US judge has ruled to dismiss a lawsuit claiming that McKinsey's bankruptcy practice was a "criminal enterprise" and violated conflict of interest rules governing corporate restructurings. The decision marks a significant victory for the consulting firm in its legal feud with turnaround specialist Jay Alix, who accused McKinsey of failing to declare conflicts of interest in numerous bankruptcy cases.

**Jay Alix** claimed that his former company, **AlixPartners**, would have been harmed if the allegations were true and sought damages through racketeering laws. However, Judge Jesse Furman ruled that Alix himself did not have a valid claim against McKinsey since it was Alix's former company that would be affected by any potential harm.

The dismissal of this case is part of an ongoing legal assault waged by **Alix** and his firm, which has included claims in various bankruptcy courts dating back a decade. The racketeering case had previously been dismissed once before but was reinstated upon appeal.

McKinsey entered the restructuring business as a competitor to AlixPartners in 2amo and maintains that the claims are without merit. Following the ruling, McKinsey expressed relief at having the case dismissed again. Furman's decision was based on the fact that **Alix** did not have explicit rights assigned to any racketeering claims by AlixPartners.

Sean O’Shea, an attorney for Jay Alix, disagreed with the ruling and expects to appeal a second time, indicating that this may not be the end of the legal battle between McKinsey and Alix.
