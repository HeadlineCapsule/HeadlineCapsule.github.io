卡玛拉·哈里斯效仿碧昂丝来反击特朗普的“激进”攻击

# 卡玛拉·哈里斯发布首支数字视频，反击唐纳德·特朗普和共和党的攻击

**摘要：** 民主党副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）发布了她的第一段数字视频，以反击唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）和共和党的攻击。该视频描绘了哈里斯作为温和的中间派，与民主党所感知的共和党所推广的混乱、恐惧和仇恨形成对比。

**要点：**
- 卡玛拉·哈里斯发布了她的第一段竞选视频，其中包含她在威斯康星州密尔沃基市集会上的画面，并与特朗普及其副手JD Vance的画面进行对比，以突显他们的差异。
- 视频使用了碧昂丝（Beyoncé）的歌曲《自由》（Freedom），并强调了自由免于枪支暴力和生殖权利等主题。
- 共和党人早就开始攻击哈里斯，称她在移民、犯罪和能源政策等问题上过于自由派。特朗普给她起了绰号“说谎的卡玛拉·哈里斯”（Lyin' Kamala Harris），并呼吁在即将举行的选举中击败她。
- 拜登政府因支持以色列加沙战争以及最近对通过美国南部边境的移民实施限制而受到进步民主党人的批评。
- 哈里斯旨在吸引摇摆和独立选民，同时支持她的白宫竞选的民主党团体“优先事项USA”发布了一个广告，对比了她对堕胎权的辩护与特朗普任命最高法院法官推翻终止妊娠宪法权利的行为。

 **Summary:** Kamala Harris, Democratic vice-president and candidate for White House bid, releases first digital video to counter attacks from Donald Trump and Republicans. The video portrays Harris as a moderate centrist in contrast to what Democrats perceive as chaos, fear, and hate promoted by the Republican party.

**Key Points:**
- Kamala Harris released her first campaign video featuring images of herself at a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, juxtaposed with those of Trump and his running mate JD Vance to highlight their differences.
- The video includes music from Beyoncé's "Freedom" song and emphasizes themes such as freedom from gun violence and reproductive rights.
- Republicans have launched early attacks against Harris, portraying her as hyper-liberal on issues like immigration, crime, and energy policies. Trump has nicknamed her "Lyin' Kamala Harris" and called for her to be defeated in the upcoming election.
- The Biden administration has faced criticism from progressive Democrats over its support for Israel's war in Gaza and recent restrictions on immigration through the US's southern border.
- Harris aims to attract swing and independent voters, while Priorities USA, a Democratic group backing her White House bid, released an ad contrasting her defense of abortion rights with Trump's appointments to the Supreme Court that overturned the constitutional right to end a pregnancy.
