微软和西方石油签署碳信用交易协议，以帮助抵消人工智能能源激增的影响

**微软** 和 **西方石油公司** 签署碳信用交易协议，以帮助抵消 AI 能源增长带来的排放

 *摘要*：科技巨头微软与美国大型油气企业西方石油公司达成重要协议。根据协议，微软将在六年内购买 50 万碳信用额度，用于抵消自身排放。此次合作被视为同类合作中规模最大，将帮助微软通过直接空气捕获 (DAC) 技术减少温室气体排放。

 *要点*：
 - 微软与西方石油公司的协议涉及在六年内购买 50 万碳信用额度。
 - 这是同类合作中规模最大的协议，将帮助微软通过支持直接空气捕获 (DAC) 技术来抵消排放。
 - 在人工智能扩张带来能源需求增长之际，双方正履行各自的气候承诺。
 - 碳信用额度的使用面临审核挑战，因为如何验证碳排放量从大气中去除的数量存在争议。
 - 西方石油公司预计其 DAC 信用额度售价将低于当前每吨 $1,000 的市场价格。
 - 微软的排放量自 2020 年以来上涨了近三分之一，主要原因是数据中心建设和 AI 业务扩张。微软承诺在 2030 年实现“碳负”目标。
 - 西方石油公司正扩大其二氧化碳管理业务，DAC 在控制全球气温方面发挥着重要作用。

 *额外信息*：
 - 科技行业是西方石油公司子公司 1PointFive 的重点关注领域，该公司专注于碳管理，并与亚马逊等其他公司签署了类似协议。
 - 碳信用额度应仅用于抵消钢铁生产等工业流程中难以消除的排放。
 - 微软的 DAC 信用额度将来自西方石油公司在德克萨斯州西部的第一个项目“Stratos”，该项目是全球最大的直接空气捕获设施，将于明年投运。

 **Microsoft** and **Occidental Petroleum** sign carbon credit deal to help offset AI energy surge

*Summary:* Microsoft, a major technology company, has entered into a significant agreement with Occidental Petroleum, one of the largest US oil producers. The deal involves the purchase of 500,000 carbon credits over six years by Microsoft to offset its emissions. This partnership is considered the largest of its kind and will enable Microsoft to support efforts in reducing greenhouse gas levels through a process known as direct air capture (DAC).

*Key Points:*
- The agreement between **Microsoft** and Occidental Petroleum involves 500,n000 carbon credits over six years.
- This deal is the largest of its kind to date and will help Microsoft offset emissions by supporting direct air capture (DAC) technology.
- Both companies are addressing their climate promises amid a surge in energy demands driven by artificial intelligence expansion.
- The use of carbon credits has faced scrutiny due to concerns over verifying the claims about how much carbon is removed from the atmosphere.
- Occidental Petroleum expects to sell its DAC credits at a lower market rate than the current $1,000 per tonne.
- Microsoft's emissions have risen by almost a third since 2020 due to data center construction and AI expansion. The company has pledged to be "carbon negative" by 2030.
- Occidental Petroleum is expanding its carbon dioxide management business, with DAC playing an important role in the race to keep global temperatures in check.

*Additional Information:*
- The tech sector is a priority for **Occidental's** subsidiary 1PointFive, which focuses on carbon management and has signed similar deals with other companies like Amazon.
- Carbon credits should only be used to offset hard-to-eliminate emissions from industrial processes such as steelmaking.
- Microsoft's DAC credits will come from Occidental Petroleum's first project, Stratos, in West Texas, which is set to be the world's largest facility when it goes online next year.
