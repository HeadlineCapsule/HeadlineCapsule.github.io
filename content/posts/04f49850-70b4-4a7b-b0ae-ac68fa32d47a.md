得克萨斯人因飓风贝里尔切断电力而苦不堪言

**热带风暴贝里尔** 在德克萨斯州造成了广泛的破坏，风暴过后两天，近200万户家庭仍然没有电力供应。周一早上飓风袭击后，休斯顿地区出现了大范围的洪水和倒下的电线杆。至少有10人因贝里尔而死亡。

恢复工作进展缓慢，州政府和联邦政府之间就如何加快恢复电力供应的问题发生了冲突。美国国家气象局警告说，持续的停电和没有空调会增加热相关疾病的风险，因为温度和湿度都很高。

德克萨斯州州长格雷格·阿伯特正在亚洲进行经济发展之旅，这使得美国总统乔·拜登很难联系他，正式提出灾难声明请求，以加快联邦援助的进程。州长否认了这一说法，称他在飓风期间没有收到总统的任何电话。

由于休斯顿的主要公用事业公司 CenterPoint 恢复电力供应的速度缓慢，该公司的140万用户在周三上午仍然没有电力供应。该公司从全国各地调来了近12,000名一线工人来帮助恢复电力，并致力于在当天结束前增加恢复供电的家庭数量。

由于家中没有电力供应，无法忍受酷热天气，居民们只能前往冷却中心或酒吧、咖啡馆等公共场所避暑。

 **Hurricane Beryl** caused widespread damage across Texas, leaving nearly 2 million households without electricity two days after the storm hit. The Houston area experienced extensive flooding and downed power lines due to the hurricane's impact on Monday morning. At least 10 people were killed as a result of Beryl.

The recovery effort has been slow, with clashes between state and federal authorities over the pace of restoring electricity in America's fourth-largest city. The National Weather Service warned that continued power outages and lack of air conditioning would increase the risk for heat-related illnesses due to high temperatures and humidity levels.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has been on an economic development trip in Asia, leading President Joe Biden to express difficulty in tracking him down for a formal request of disaster declaration to expedite federal aid. The governor denied the claim, stating that he had not received any calls from the president during Hurricane Beryl.

Houston's main utility company, CenterPoint, has faced scrutiny over its slow recovery pace, accounting for 1.4 million of the outages on Wednesday morning. The company brought in nearly 12,000 frontline workers from various states to assist with restoring power and aimed to increase the number of restored households by the end of the day.

Residents have been seeking shelter at cooling centers or public places like bars and coffee shops due to unbearable heat conditions in their homes without electricity.
