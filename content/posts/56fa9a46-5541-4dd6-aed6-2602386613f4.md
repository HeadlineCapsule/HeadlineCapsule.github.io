俄罗斯以“间谍”罪判处记者埃万·杰尔斯科维奇（Evan Gershkovich）16年监禁

俄罗斯法院以间谍罪判处《华尔街日报》记者埃文·杰尔斯科维奇（Evan Gershkovich） 16 年监禁。这一判决被视为潜在的囚犯交换序曲，涉及被美国和其他西方国家关押的俄罗斯人。

斯维尔德洛夫斯克地区法院的裁决结束了杰尔斯科维奇的快速审判，这是自冷战以来首位因间谍罪被捕的美国记者。尽管他在闭门听证会上否认指控，但检察官声称他受CIA指派，任务是获取该区域一家工厂的坦克生产和维修的“机密信息”。

俄罗斯当局没有公开提供支持其对杰尔斯科维奇指控的证据。自去年被捕以来，他已被拘留 478 天。美国政府和《华尔街日报》坚持认为这些指控是毫无根据的。

在判决后，美国总统乔·拜登强调了新闻自由的重要性，并誓言将继续为杰尔斯科维奇的释放而努力。他还提到了为确保其他被错误拘留的美国人获释所做的努力。

《华尔街日报》出版商阿尔马尔·拉图尔（Almar Latour）和编辑艾玛·塔克（Emma Tucker）谴责这一“假定有罪”的判决，称其为对新闻自由的侵犯，并承诺将继续支持杰尔斯科维奇的家庭并寻求他的获释。

俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京表示愿意进行交换，涉及杰尔斯科维奇和其他被拘留者，例如美国海军陆战队退伍军人保罗·惠兰（Paul Whelan）和去年被德国判处终身监禁的俄罗斯杀手瓦迪姆·克拉西科夫（Vadim Krasikov）。

莫斯科之前曾进行过囚犯交换；2022 年，它用篮球明星布里特妮·格里纳（Brittney Griner）换取了军火商维克多·布特（Viktor Bout）。俄罗斯外长谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫（Sergei Lavrov）表示，关于可能交换的讨论正在进行中，但他建议不要公开这一问题。

总之，俄罗斯法院以间谍罪判处杰尔斯科维奇有罪引起了人们对新闻自由和侵犯人权行为的担忧。该案被视为可能导致多国囚犯交换，美国官员积极寻求与被拘留的美国人获释。

 **Russia Convicts Wall Street Journal Reporter Evan Gershkovich for Espionage**

- A Russian court has sentenced US journalist Evan Gershkovich, a reporter for the *Wall Street Journal*, to 16 years in prison on espionage charges. This conviction is seen as a potential prelude to a prisoner exchange involving Russians held in the US and other western countries.

- The Sverdlovsky regional court's verdict ended an unusually rapid trial for Gershkovich, marking him as the first US reporter arrested for spying in Russia since the Cold War era. Despite his denial of accusations during closed-door hearings, prosecutors claimed he was on a CIA assignment to obtain "secret information" about tank production and repair at a factory in the region.

- Russian authorities have not publicly provided evidence supporting their claims against Gershkovich, who has been detained for 478 days since his arrest last year. The US government and *Wall Street Journal* maintain that the charges are baseless.

- Following the verdict, US President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of press freedom and vowed to continue pushing for Gershkovich's release. He also mentioned efforts to secure the release of other Americans wrongfully detained abroad.

- *Wall Street Journal* publisher Almar Latour and editor Emma Tucker condemned the "sham conviction" as a violation of journalistic freedom, promising continued support for Gershkovich's family and his eventual release.

- Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed openness to an exchange involving Gershkovich and other detained individuals such as US Marine veteran Paul Whelan and German hitman Vadim Krasikov, who was sentenced to life in prison by Germany in 지난해.

- The possibility of a prisoner swap is not new for Moscow; it previously exchanged basketball star Brittney Griner with arms dealer Viktor Bout in 2022. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that discussions over a possible exchange were ongoing, though he advised against publicizing the matter.

In summary, Evan Gershkovich's conviction for espionage by a Russian court has raised concerns about press freedom and human rights violations. The case is seen as potentially leading to a prisoner swap involving multiple countries, with US officials actively seeking his release alongside other detained Americans.
