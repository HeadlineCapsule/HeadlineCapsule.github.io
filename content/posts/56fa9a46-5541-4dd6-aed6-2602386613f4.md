俄罗斯以“间谍”罪判处记者埃万·杰尔斯科维奇（Evan Gershkovich）16年监禁

俄罗斯记者埃文·杰尔斯科维奇被判入狱16年

俄罗斯一家法院以间谍罪判处《华尔街日报》记者埃文·杰尔斯科维奇（Evan Gershkovich） 19 年有期徒刑，并被判处在严格保安的惩罚殖民地服刑。根据俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京的说法，这一判决被视为他通过美国和其他西方国家所持有俄罗斯人进行囚犯交换的潜在序曲。

背景：

杰尔斯科维奇去年被捕时正在接受CIA的任务，以获取有关俄罗斯斯维尔德洛夫斯克地区一家工厂坦克生产和维修的“机密信息”。俄罗斯政府声称已经当场抓住了他，但尚未公开任何证据。美国和《华尔街日报》都驳斥这些指控是毫无根据的。

美国反应：

在杰尔斯科维奇被判罪后，美国总统乔·拜登强调新闻自由不是犯罪，并表示他的政府将继续推动埃文的释放。白宫已经明确表示，确保所有被错误地拘押在国外的美国人安全返回是他们的最高优先事项。

《华尔街日报》立场：

《华尔街日报》出版商阿尔马尔·拉图尔（Almar Latour）和编辑艾玛·塔克（Emma Tucker）谴责对杰尔斯科维奇的定罪是骗局，表示他们将竭尽全力推动他的释放并支持他的家人。他们重申新闻自由不是犯罪，并誓言将继续努力直到他获释。

潜在的囚犯交换：

美国官员据报正在努力确保杰尔斯科维奇以及因间谍罪在俄罗斯服刑16年的美国海军陆战队退伍军人保罗·惠兰（Paul Whelan）的释放。俄罗斯总统普京对交换表示开放态度，并暗示莫斯科希望换回在德国被判终身监禁的杀手瓦迪姆·克拉斯科（Vadim Krasikov）。

国际反应：

德国外交部长安娜莱娜·贝尔博克（Annalena Baerbock）批评杰尔斯科维奇的定罪是出于政治动机，是普京战争宣传的一部分。她强调新闻自由不是犯罪，真相不能被关押。

总之，埃文·杰尔斯科维奇因间谍罪被判入狱16年，引发了国际社会的愤怒和对他释放的呼吁。通过美国所持有俄罗斯人进行囚犯交换的可能性为确保他的自由提供了机会。

 **Russia jails reporter Evan Gershkovich for 16 years**  
A Russian court has convicted Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich of espionage and sentenced him to nineteen years in a high-security penal colony. This verdict is seen as a potential prelude to his release through a prisoner swap involving Russians held in the US and other western countries, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

**Background:**  
Gershkovich was arrested last year while on an assignment from the CIA to obtain "secret information" about tank production and repair at a factory in Russia's Sverdlovsk region. The Russian government claimed it had caught him red-handed but has not provided any evidence publicly. Both the US and WSJ have dismissed the charges as baseless.

**US Response:**  
In response to Gershkovich's conviction, US President Joe Biden emphasized that journalism is not a crime and stated his administration would continue pushing for Evan's release. The White House has made it clear that securing the safe return of all Americans wrongfully detained abroad is their highest priority.

**WSJ Stance:**  
The WSJ publisher Almar Latour and editor Emma Tucker condemned Gershkovich's conviction as a sham, stating they would do everything possible to press for his release and support his family. They reiterated that journalism is not a crime and vowed to continue their efforts until he is released.

**Potential Prisoner Swap:**  
US officials are reportedly working on securing the release of Gershkovich, as well as Paul Whelan, a US Marine veteran serving a 16-year sentence for espionage in Russia. Russian President Putin has expressed openness to an exchange and hinted that Moscow wants Vadim Krasikov, a hitman sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany, in return.

**International Reactions:**  
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock criticized Gershkovich's conviction as politically motivated and part of Putin's war propaganda. She emphasized that journalism is not a crime and the truth cannot be locked up.

In conclusion, Evan Gershkovich's 16-year sentence for espionage has sparked international outrage and calls for his release. The possibility of a prisoner swap involving Russians held in the US may provide an opportunity to secure his freedom.
