马斯克将寻求特斯拉董事会批准向xAI初创公司注入5亿美元资金

**埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）提议向人工智能初创公司投资50亿美元**

特斯拉（Tesla）首席执行官埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）计划寻求董事会批准，向他的人工智能初创公司xAI投资50亿美元。随着特斯拉从电动汽车制造商转型为机器人与人工智能公司，这一举动可能会引发利益冲突的担忧。

马斯克在社交媒体上宣布了这一提议，他询问关注者是否支持在获得董事会批准和股东投票的情况下向xAI投资50亿美元。在得到公众的大力支持后，马斯克打算与特斯拉的董事会讨论此事。

在马斯克的领导下，这家汽车制造商一直在努力将自己品牌化为一支机器人与人工智能公司。计划包括利用xAI在自动驾驶技术培训和数据中心建设等领域的知识，建造自主的“机器人出租车”和人形机器人。

然而，这项投资可能会重新引发人们对马斯克的企业网络之间利益冲突的担忧，这些企业包括SpaceX和Neuralink。今年早些时候，马斯克承认由于特斯拉的基础设施限制，他将Nvidia芯片从特斯拉重新分配到了xAI。此外，鉴于法院最近作出裁决，取消了授予马斯克的560亿美元薪酬包，并批评董事会主席罗宾·登霍尔姆（Robyn Denholm）的监督方法，人们对特斯拉的董事会成员独立性提出了质疑。

xAI于去年正式成立，正在开发一个名为Grok的聊天机器人，并于5月以180亿美元的估值筹集了60亿美元。该初创公司与OpenAI和Anthropic等公司竞争，开发智能聊天机器人。马斯克承认，他的顶级人工智能模型落后于OpenAI的“一个数量级”。

特斯拉50亿美元的潜在投资将大大增强xAI的资源，使其在短时间内接近其大型竞争对手所拥有的强大火力。

 **Elon Musk's Proposal for a $5 Billion Investment into AI Start-up**

Tesla CEO Elon Musk plans to seek board approval for investing $5 billion into his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI. This move could potentially raise concerns over conflicts of interest as Tesla transitions from an electric vehicle maker to a robotics and AI company. 

Musk announced the proposal on social media, where he asked followers if they supported investing $5 billion into @xAI with board approval and shareholder vote required. With overwhelming public support, Musk intends to discuss this matter with Tesla's board of directors. 

The carmaker has been striving to rebrand itself as a robotics and AI company under Musk's leadership. Plans include building autonomous "robotaxis" and humanoid robots powered by advanced technology, leveraging knowledge gained from xAI in areas such as self-driving tech training and data center construction.

However, this investment could reignite concerns about conflicts of interest between Musk's network of companies, including SpaceX and Neuralink. Earlier this year, Musk admitted to reallocating Nvidia chips from Tesla to xAI due to infrastructure limitations at the carmaker. Additionally, questions have been raised regarding the independence of Tesla'amo board members in light of a recent court ruling voiding a $56 billion pay package awarded to Musk and criticizing board chair Robyn Denholm for her oversight approach.

xAI, officially founded last year, is developing a chatbot called Grok and raised $6 billion at an $18 billion valuation in May. The start-up competes with rivals OpenAI and Anthropic to develop intelligence chatbots. Musk acknowledged that his top AI model lags behind OpenAI's by "an order of magnitude."

A potential $5 billion investment from Tesla would significantly bolster xAI's resources, bringing it closer to the firepower amassed by its larger competitors in a short time frame.
