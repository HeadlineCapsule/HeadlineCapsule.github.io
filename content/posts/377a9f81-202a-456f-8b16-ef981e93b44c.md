野村银行家在禁令解除后离开中国大陆

# 摘要：
被禁止离开中国大陆的高盛银行家查尔斯·王中合（Charles Wang Zhonghe）最近获准离境，此前他因科技交易商包凡（Bao Fan）的调查而被禁止离境。这一消息让依赖高管能够进出内地的银行和多国企业松了一口气。

# 要点：
- 高盛中国投资银行主席王中合因包凡调查而被禁止离开中国大陆。
- 对像王这样的高管实施的离境禁令在香港金融界引起了担忧，并引发了对中国商业环境信心的质疑。
- 银行和多国公司依赖于其高管能够在大陆和其他地区（如香港）之间自由旅行。
- 美国国务院建议人们重新考虑前往中国的旅行计划，因为当地存在任意执法和离境禁令等问题。
- 王中合于2018年加入高盛，此前曾在国际建行和德意志银行工作；他于1996年从华尔街搬到了香港。

 **Summary:**
A senior Nomura banker, Charles Wang Zhonghe, who was previously banned from leaving mainland China amid an investigation into tech dealmaker Bao Fan, is now allowed to leave the country after the exit ban was lifted within the past few months. The news comes as a relief for banks and multinational businesses that rely on their executives being able to move in and out of the mainland.

**Key Points:**
- Charles Wang Zhonghe, chair of investment banking for China at Nomura International, was banned from leaving mainland China last year due to an investigation into Bao Fan.
- The exit ban on a senior figure like Wang caused concern within the financial community in Hong Kong and raised questions about confidence in China's business environment.
- Banks and multinational companies depend on their executives being able to travel freely between mainland China and other regions, such as Hong Kong.
- The US state department advises people to reconsider travelling to China due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including exit bans.
- Wang joined Nomura in 2018 after working at ICBC International and Deutsche Bank; he moved to Hong Kong from Wall Street in 1996.
