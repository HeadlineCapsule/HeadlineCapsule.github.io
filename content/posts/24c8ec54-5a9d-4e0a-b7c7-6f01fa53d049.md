台积电看好AI长期发展

台湾积体电路制造公司（TSMC）为持续的AI蓬勃发展带来了希望，尽管唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）最近发表敌对言论，并担心新的出口管制。 TSMC 2023 年第二季度财务表现强劲，净利润跳增 36% 至 2478 亿新台币（78.5 亿美元），收入增长 40% 至 6735 亿新台币，优于其此前指导。

该公司将全年**收入增长**预测提高了略高于 25%，高于此前的 20-25% 的估计。尽管美国政策构成了潜在风险，但 TSMC 的管理层仍对扩大海外工厂和在美国亚利桑那州投资 650 亿美元的计划充满信心。

TSMC 是领先的先进芯片制造商，为英伟达（Nvidia）等公司提供芯片。该公司预计 AI 和智能手机部门的需求强劲将支持其业务。为了满足需求，TSMC 还增加了资本支出预算。然而，人们担心其在 CoWos 技术方面的能力限制，管理层表示供应与需求的平衡可能要到 2025 年或 2026 年才能实现。

尽管唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）关于台湾及其芯片行业的言论之后市场波动，但 TSMC 在台北的股价仅下跌 2.4%，而台证所基准指数下跌了 1%。该公司对 AI 技术的未来充满乐观，并继续大量投资以扩大产能以满足需求。

 **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)** raises hopes for a prolonged AI boom, despite recent hostile comments by Donald Trump and fears about new export controls. TSMC reported strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2023 with a 36% jump in net profit to NT$247.8bn (US$7.cu) and a 40% increase in revenue to NT$673.5bn, outperforming its previous guidance.

The company raised its full-year forecast for **revenue growth** by slightly over 25%, up from the earlier estimate of 20-25%. TSMC's management remains confident in their plans to expand overseas fabs and invest US$65bn in Arizona, despite potential risks posed by US policy.

TSMC is a leading manufacturer of advanced chips for companies such as **AI chip leader Nvidia**. The company expects strong demand from the AI and smartphone sectors to support its business. TSMC also increased its capital expenditure budget, citing efforts to meet this demand. However, there are concerns about capacity constraints in their CoWos technology, with management indicating that a balance between supply and demand may not be achieved until 2025 or 2026.

Despite recent market volatility following Donald Trump's comments on Taiwan and its chip industry, TSMC shares closed only 2.4% lower in Taipei, with the Taiex benchmark index down by 1%. The company remains optimistic about the future of AI technology and continues to invest heavily in expanding capacity to meet demand.
