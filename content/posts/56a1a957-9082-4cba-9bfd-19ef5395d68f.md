伊隆·马斯克表示，他计划将太空探索技术公司和X公司的总部从加州迁至得克萨斯州。

亿万富翁企业家埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）周二宣布，由于加州州长加文·纽瑟姆签署了一项新的性别认同法，他决定将SpaceX和X总部从加州迁至得克萨斯州。该法律禁止加州学区向学生家长披露学生的性取向或性别认同信息。这是马斯克一系列表达对州政策和运营不满的举措中的最新行动。

关键点：
- 埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）计划因不赞同加利福尼亚州的性别认同新法而将SpaceX和X总部从加州迁至得克萨斯州。
- 这一决定是马斯克一系列表达对州政策或运营不满的举措的一部分。
- 这一搬迁可能标志着硅谷的损失，因为当地对政治、监管、犯罪和无家可归等问题越来越感到失望和担忧。
- 得克萨斯州因低税收和低监管的方法而吸引了众多从加州搬迁的企业总部。

背景：
加文·纽瑟姆州长签署的新性别认同法禁止加州学区向学生家长披露学生的性取向或性别认同信息。马斯克过去曾因有关跨性别者的公开言论而引起争议，并且一年前表示，这样的法律会迫使家庭和公司离开加州。

影响：
SpaceX和X离开硅谷可能会对该地区产生重大影响，因为该地区面临着高办公空置率、下降的税收收入以及对当地政治和监管的担忧等挑战。得克萨斯州因其低税收和低监管的环境而欢迎搬迁到那里的公司。

反应：
得克萨斯州的共和党人对马斯克的决定表示支持，参议员泰德·克鲁兹（Ted Cruz）表示，他们为SpaceX将得克萨斯州作为总部感到自豪，州长格雷格·阿伯特（Greg Abbott）则强调了该州在太空探索方面的领导地位。

 **Summary:**  
Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk announced on Tuesday his decision to move SpaceX and X headquarters from California to Texas due to a new gender identity law signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, which bans California school districts from disclosing information about students' sexual orientation or gender identity. This marks the latest in a series of moves by Musk as he expresses dissatisfaction with state policies and operations.

**Key Points:**  
- Elon Musk plans to move SpaceX and X headquarters from California to Texas, citing disagreement with California's new gender identity law.
- The decision is part of a series of moves by Musk in response to his dissatisfaction with state policies or operations.
- This relocation could mark a loss for Silicon Valley amid increasing disenchantment and concerns over local politics, regulation, crime, and homelessness.
- Texas has seen a surge in corporate headquarters relocations from California due to its low-tax, low-regulation approach.

**Background:**  
The new gender identity law signed by Governor Gavin Newsom prohibits California school districts from disclosing information about students' sexual orientation or gender identity to their parents. Musk has previously stirred controversy with his public statements on transgender people and had communicated a year ago that such laws would force families and companies to leave California.

**Impact:**  
The departure of SpaceX and X from Silicon Valley could have significant implications for the region, as it faces challenges like high office vacancies, declining tax revenues, and concerns over local politics and regulation. Texas has been welcoming to companies relocating there due to its low-tax, low-regulation environment.

**Reactions:**  
Texas Republicans have expressed support for Musk's decision, with Senator Ted Cruz stating that they are proud SpaceX calls Texas home and Governor Greg Abbott emphasizing the state's leadership in space exploration.
