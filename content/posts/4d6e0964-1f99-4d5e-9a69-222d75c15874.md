基金经理在向零费用的竞争中放弃了数十亿美元的费用。

**摘要：**
美国基金经理去年面临着费用减少的情况，减少了近34亿美元，因为在主动管理互惠基金（mutual fund）的损失中，交易所交易基金（ETF）继续增长。平均资产加权费用比率从0.37%降至0.36%，标志着数十年来基金费用的下降趋势。

**要点：**
1. 美国投资者去年在基金费用上节省了近34亿美元，平均资产加权费用比率下降到0.36%。
2. 主动管理基金经历了资金外流，因为资金被转移到更便宜的被动基金中；在过去的两年中，被动基金吸引了超过1.1万亿美元的新资金，而主动基金则损失了近1.4万亿美元。
3. Dimensional是美国最大的资产管理公司之一，管理着近7400亿美元的资产，其主动管理的ETF获得了受欢迎程度，尽管也存在来自互惠基金客户的竞争。
4. 主动和被动基金之间的竞争正在加剧，因为它们都在争夺顾问和投资者的关注；这导致主动管理的ETF与互惠基金包装中的类似策略相比，费用较低。
5. Morningstar指出，“最便宜的”需求一直很稳定，在过去的15年中，所有基金中最便宜的10%削减了费用的近一半，并在过去的两年中收集了90%的所有流入资金。
6. 投资公司研究所（Investment Company Institute）报告称，从2014年到2023年，美国国内股票互惠基金和ETF获得了2.5万亿美元的新资金，而主动管理的国内股票互惠基金则经历了2.6万亿美元的净流出（包括重新投资股息）。
7. 资产管理公司面临着挑战，因为它们需要管理越来越大的资金池才能在公共基金业务方面实现收支平衡，而且表现往往令人失望且短暂。
8. 有迹象表明，费用压力可能正在触底，一些基金开始提高费用；然而，这可能是由于流出所触发的自动费用调整。

 **Summary:**  
Fund managers in the US faced a significant reduction of nearly $3.n4bn in fees last year, as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued their growth at the expense of actively managed mutual funds. The average asset-weighted expense ratio decreased from 0.37% to 0.36%, marking a multi-decade downward trend in fund fees.

**Key Points:**  
1. **US investors saved nearly $3.4bn** in fund expenses last year, with the average asset-weighted expense ratio dropping to 0.36%.
2. Actively managed funds have experienced outflows as money is redirected towards cheaper passive funds; over the past two years, passive funds attracted more than $1.1tn in net new money while active funds shed almost $1.4tn.
3. **Dimensional**, one of the largest US asset managers with nearly $740bn in assets under management, has seen its actively managed ETFs gain popularity despite some cannibalization from mutual fund customers.
4. The competition between active and passive funds is intensifying as both vie for advisers' and investors' attention; this results in lower fees charged by actively managed ETFs compared to similar strategies in the mutual fund wrapper.
5. **Morningstar** notes that demand for "the cheapest of the cheap" has been consistent, with the least costly 10% of all funds cutting their fees almost in half over the past 15 years and collecting 90% of all inflows over the past two years.
6. The **Investment Company Institute** reports that index US domestic equity mutual funds and ETFs received $2.5tn in net new cash from 2014 through 2023, while actively managed domestic equity mutual funds experienced net outflows of $2.6tn (including reinvested dividends).
7. **Asset managers** are facing challenges as they need to manage ever larger pools of money just to break even on the public funds side of their business, with performance often being disappointing and fleeting.
8. Signs indicate that fee pressure could be bottoming out, with some funds beginning to raise fees; however, this may result from automatic fee adjustments triggered by outflows.
