芯片股暴跌 特朗普言论吓坏投资者

# 芯片股票出现大幅下跌，投资者对特朗普关于台湾国防经费的言论和有关美国可能对中国实施更严格半导体贸易限制的报道作出反应。

纳斯达克综合指数下跌了2.8%，创2022年12月以来的最大单日跌幅，而标准普尔500指数下跌了1.4%。

## 要点：
- 半导体股票引领市场下跌，英伟达下跌6.6%，AMD下跌10.2%。
- 欧洲的ASML股价下跌11%，此前有报道称，包括这家荷兰半导体设备制造商在内的公司可能受到对华销售贸易限制。
- 费城半导体指数因这些下跌而损失了4960亿美元的市值。
- 特朗普关于台湾支付国防费用以及拜登政府考虑实施更严格贸易限制的言论加剧了投资者的担忧。
- 投资者越来越关注政治风险，资金从大型股流向小型公司。
- 在亚洲敞口股票下跌的同时，芯片股票中在美国制造能力更多的股票出现上涨。

## 分析师观点：
AJ Bell的丹·科茨沃思（Dan Coatsworth）指出，投资者对任何负面消息都感到意外，导致市场恐慌。Interactive Brokers的史蒂夫·索斯尼克（Steve Sosnick）提到，远离科技巨头股票可能推动市场上涨。巴克莱银行（Barclays）的阿贾伊·拉贾迪雅克沙（Ajay Rajadhyaksha）强调了政治风险加剧和积极的轮换交易是导致这些波动的原因。

## 市场影响：
今年推动美国股市上涨的半导体行业现在面临着地缘政治紧张局势和潜在贸易限制带来的不确定性。

 **Summary:**  
Chip stocks experienced significant declines as investors reacted to comments from former US President Donald Trump regarding Taiwan's defense funding and reports on potential stricter semiconnductor trade restrictions with China. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.8%, marking its worst day since December 2022, while the S&P 500 dropped by 1.4%.

**Key Points:**  
- Semiconductor stocks led market declines with Nvidia down 6.6% and AMD falling 10.2%.
- ASML in Europe saw an 11% drop following reports of potential trade restrictions on sales to China, including the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker.
- The Philadelphia Semiconductor index lost $496bn in market value due to these declines.
- Trump's comments about Taiwan paying for its defense and Biden administration considering stricter trade restrictions added to investors' concerns.
- Investors are increasingly focused on political risks, with a rotation away from large-cap stocks towards smaller companies.
- Chip stocks with more US manufacturing capacity saw gains amidst the declines in Asian exposure stocks.

**Analyst Insights:**  
Dan Coatsworth of AJ Bell noted that investors are caught off guard by any negativity, causing panic on the markets. Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers mentioned a potential rotation away from megacap tech stocks driving market rallies. Ajay Rajadhyaksha at Barclays highlighted heightened political risk and aggressive rotation trades as factors contributing to these moves.

**Market Impact:**  
The semiconductor industry, which has been a significant driver of US equity market gains this year, is now facing increased uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions and potential trade restrictions.
