埃姆布拉尔公司寄希望于区域喷气式飞机，以在本十年结束前使收入翻番

**埃姆布拉尔的收入目标：** 埃姆布拉尔计划在未来十年将地区和商务喷气机的销售收入翻一番，力争在现有产品的基础上将公司发展成为100亿美元的企业[^1]。这家巴西集团专注于推销其现代化的、具有竞争力的产品组合。

**目前的表现：** 2023年，埃姆布拉尔销售额达到53亿美元，截至第二季度末，订单积压量为211亿美元，是七年来最高水平[^2]。今年以来，该公司的股价上涨了80%以上。

**市场地位：** 埃姆布拉尔是世界第三大民用飞机制造商，也是地区喷气机的主要生产商，在后疫情时代一直在增加产量[^3]。其最新型号E195-E2可承载多达146名乘客。

**潜在的市场扩张：** 尽管业内人士关注埃姆布拉尔打破空客和波音的两强格局，但首席执行官弗朗西斯科·戈麦斯·内托（Francisco Gomes Neto）表示，他们目前没有具体计划推出更大的飞机，但正在研究各个细分领域的机会[^4]。分析师认为，任何此类举措都将需要合作伙伴，因为规模存在差异。

**与竞争对手的比较：** 埃姆布拉尔预计今年收入将在60亿美元到64亿美元之间，交付72-80架商用飞机和125-135架商务喷气机。相比之下，空客计划交付约770架商用飞机[^5]。分析师认为，打破两强格局需要说服客户从空客和波音等成熟公司转向埃姆布拉尔。

**合作机会：** 分析师认可埃姆布拉尔的专业知识，但他们认为埃姆布拉尔缺乏资金在不建立合作伙伴关系的情况下推出大型喷气机[^6]。该公司继续寻求与沙特阿拉伯等国家的国际国防产品合作伙伴关系。

 **Embraer's Revenue Goals:** Embraer plans to double revenues from sales of its regional and business jets over the next decade, aiming for a potential $1^0bn company by the end of this decade using existing products[^1]. The Brazilian group is focused on selling their modern and competitive portfolio.

**Current Performance:** In 2023, Embraer generated $5.3bn in sales with an order backlog of $21.1bn at the end of Q2 - its highest in seven years[^2]. Shares have soared over 80% since the start of the year.

**Market Position:** The world's third-largest civil aircraft manufacturer, Embraer is a leading producer of regional jets and has been ramping up production post-Covid pandemic[^3]. Its latest model, E195-E2, can carry up to 146 passengers.

**Potential Market Expansion:** While there's industry attention on Embraer breaking the Airbus and Boeing duopoly, CEO Francisco Gomes Neto stated that they have no concrete plans for a larger aircraft but are studying opportunities in various segments[^4]. Analysts suggest any move would require partnership due to size differences.

**Comparison with Competitors:** Embraer expects $6bn-$6.4bn revenues this year, delivering 72-80 commercial and 125-135 business jets. In contrast, Airbus plans about 770 commercial aircraft[^5]. Analysts believe breaking the duopoly would require persuading customers to switch from established companies like Airbus and Boeing.

**Partnership Opportunities:** Embraer's expertise is recognized by analysts, but they lack the cash for a larger jet launch without partnerships[^6]. The company continues pursuing international defense product partnerships with countries such as Saudi Arabia.
