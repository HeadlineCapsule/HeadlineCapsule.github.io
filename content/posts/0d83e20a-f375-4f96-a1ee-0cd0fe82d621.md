布鲁克菲尔德在英国养老金领域加注保险初创企业

**布鲁克菲尔德的战略举措**：加拿大集团布鲁克菲尔德已向英国 prudential Regulation Authority 申请保险牌照，这表明其战略方向发生了转变，不再追求像养老金保险公司这样的收购目标，而是转向在英国建立自己的保险公司。

**战略转变的原因**：选择建立而不是购买的决定可能是由布鲁克菲尔德进入英国养老金行业的愿望所驱动的，该行业最近经历了私营资本的涌入，由于利率上升导致定义福利养老金计划的资金短缺减少，因此具有显著的增长潜力。

**英国养老金市场概述**：英国的定义福利养老金计划持有 1.2 万亿英镑的资产，其中很大一部分尚未从企业资产负债表中转移出来，预计未来十年每年批量年金转移的规模将保持在 500 亿英镑左右。

**布鲁克菲尔德面临的挑战**：由于复杂的投资安排或市场新手，从 PRA 获取保险牌照的过程可能需要超过六个月，并且由于现有保险公司寻求加强其资源，专业技能市场紧俏。

**潜在结果**：鉴于其规模和美国的经验，布鲁克菲尔德在英国养老金行业重新开始的能力可能是独特的；然而，它仍然可以“先建后买”，以利用当前的市场机遇。这一举措可能会吸引更多人关注可收购的保险公司，例如 PIC 和 Just Group，但最终，由于英国养老金行业竞争加剧，私营进入者和现有保险公司的回报可能被削减。

 **Brookfield's Strategic Move**: Canadian group Brookfield has applied for an insurance license from the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority, signaling a shift towards building its own insurance company in the UK instead of pursuing acquisitions like Pensions Insurance Corporation.

**Reason Behind Strategy Change**: The decision to build rather than buy may be driven by Brookfield's desire to enter the UK pension sector, which has seen an influx of private capital and offers significant growth potential due to rising interest rates reducing funding shortfalls for defined benefit pension schemes.

**UK Pensions Market Overview**: Defined benefit pension schemes in the UK hold £1.n2tn of assets with a large portion yet to be shifted off corporate balance sheets, and bulk annuity transfers are expected to remain at around £50bn per year for the next decade.

**Challenges Faced by Brookfield**: The process of obtaining an insurance license from the PRA may take longer than six months due to complex investment arrangements or market newcomers, and there is a tight market for specialist skills as existing insurers seek to bolster their resources.

**Potential Outcomes**: Brookfield's ability to start afresh in the UK pensions sector may be unique given its size and US experience; however, it could still "build then buy" to capitalize on the current market opportunities. This move is likely to attract more attention towards acquirable insurers such as PIC and Just Group, but ultimately, returns for private entrants and existing insurers may be trimmed due to increased competition in the UK pensions sector.
