唐纳德·特朗普选择俄亥俄州参议员JD·万斯作为其2024年竞选伙伴。

唐纳德·特朗普选择俄亥俄州参议员JD Vance作为其2024年总统竞选的竞选伙伴。这位《山丘比利雅传》的作者，年轻的前海军陆战队员，被选中吸引工业中西部摇摆州中的蓝领选民，尽管他之前曾描述特朗普是“傻瓜”。

Vance是一位39岁的耶鲁大学法学院毕业生，曾在美国海军陆战队服役，并在风险投资领域工作过，然后才进入政界。他在两年前首次当选参议员，标志着他在共和党内的迅速崛起，也完成了共和党在11月选举前不到四个月的票数。

尽管Vance在过去曾批评过这位前总统，但近年来他一直是特朗普最坚定的支持者之一。他对自己以前的言论辩护，称其为一个“错误”，并说在他看到特朗普是一个伟大的总统，改变了许多美国人的想法后，他改变了关于特朗普的想法。

特朗普在密尔沃基举行的共和党全国代表大会上宣布Vance是他的竞选伙伴，他们出现在大会上仅仅两天后，一名枪手试图暗杀特朗普。前总统带着包扎的耳朵进入会场，得到了人群的起立鼓掌。

Vance的背景被认为对吸引宾夕法尼亚州、密歇根州、威斯康星州、俄亥俄州等关键摇摆州的选民很有帮助。他的民粹主义政治观点在他赢得了共和党基层的支持的同时，也因其孤立主义外交政策观点和对提高最低工资和贸易保护主义的支持而在共和党传统成员中引起了担忧。

如果当选，Vance将是美国历史上第三年轻的副总统，仅次于理查德·尼克松在德怀特·艾森豪威尔手下担任副总统时。

 **Donald Trump selects Ohio senator JD Vance as his running mate for the 2024 Presidential race**. The young Marine veteran and author of 'Hillbilly Elegy' has been chosen to appeal to blue-collar voters in swing states across the industrial Midwest, despite previously describing Trump as an "idiot".

JD Vance, a 39-year-old Yale Law School graduate who served in the US Marine Corps and worked in venture capital before entering politics, was elected to the Senate for the first time just two years ago. His selection marks a swift rise within the Republican Party and completes their ticket with less than four months until November's election.

Vance has been among Trump's most ardent supporters in recent years, despite his previous criticism of the former president. He defended his past comments as a "mistake" and stated that he changed his mind about Trump after seeing him as a great president who changed many Americans' minds.

Trump announced Vance as his running mate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where they appeared together just two days after a gunman attempted to assassinate Trump. The former president entered the hall with a bandaged ear and received a standing ovation from the crowd.

Vance's background is seen as an asset for appealing to voters in critical battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Minnesota. His brand of populist politics has earned him praise within the Republican base but also raised concerns among more traditional party members due to his isolationist foreign policy views and support for a higher minimum wage and trade protectionism.

Vance would be the third-youngest vice president in US history if elected, with only Richard Nixon being younger when he became vice president under Dwight Eisenhower.
