泰晤士水公司的信用评级降至“垃圾”

**摘要：**
台湾水务公司泰晤士水务公司的信用评级被穆迪下调至“垃圾”等级。此次降级使该公司面临违反许可证的风险，并增加了其 165 亿英镑债务的压力。为了符合其许可证的要求，水务公司需要维持两个投资级评级，但由于其流动性地位削弱以及债务违约风险增加，现在其评级低于该阈值。

降级可能会增加泰晤士水务公司的借贷成本，如果该公司无法偿还债务或未能提供高效的水供应和污水处理系统，可能会导致政府特别管理政权接管该公司。水务公司必须在明年五月之前从投资者那里筹集 7.5 亿英镑的股权，到 2030 年还需要额外 25 亿英镑。

泰晤士水务公司的股东已宣布该业务“不可投资”，并撤回了进一步投资的承诺。由于 Ofwat 施加的限制，该公司可能很难吸引新的资本，Ofwat 提议将水费上调约五分之一，远低于英国水公司平均 33% 的要求。

穆迪的评级行动意味着泰晤士水务公司的最高级别“A 类”债券现在刚好低于投资级，而其第二级的“B 类”债券已更深地陷入垃圾债券领域。该公司的母公司还有其他借款，使集团的总债务负担超过了 180 亿英镑。

为了稳定业务并保护公众免受私有化失败的影响，政府正在考虑部署特别管理并将泰晤士水务公司转移到永久公共所有权下。

 **Summary:**  
Taiwan's water utility, Thames Water, has had its credit rating slashed to "junk" status by Moody's. This downgrade puts the company at risk of breaching its licence and adds pressure on its £16.5bn debt pile. The utility needs to maintain two investment-grade ratings in order to comply with its license, but it is now below this threshold due to a weakening liquidity position and potential covenant breaches on its debt.

The downgrade could raise borrowing costs for Thames Water and may lead to the government's special administration regime taking over the company if it cannot repay its debts or fails in providing efficient water supply and sewerage systems. The utility has until next May to raise £750mn in equity from investors, with an additional £2.5bn required by 203n.

Thames Water's shareholders have declared the business "uninvestable" and backtracked on a commitment to invest further. The company may struggle to attract new capital due to limitations placed by Ofwat, which proposed water bill increases of around a fifth, far short of the average 33% requested by UK water companies.

Moody's ratings action means that Thames Water's top-ranked "class A" bonds are now ranked just below investment-grade, while its second-ranking "Class B" bonds have slipped deeper into junk territory. The utility's parent company also has further borrowings, taking the group's overall debt burden to over £18bn.

The government is considering deploying special administration and transferring Thames Water into permanent public ownership as a solution to stabilize the business and protect the public from paying for privatization failures.
