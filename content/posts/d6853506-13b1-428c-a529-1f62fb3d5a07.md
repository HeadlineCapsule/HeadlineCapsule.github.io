英国国民保健署数据主管是帕兰提尔公司说客晚宴的“贵宾”

**摘要：**
英格兰国民保健署（NHS England）高级官员明唐（Ming Tang）是全球顾问公司（Global Counsel）举办的一场晚宴的“荣誉嘉宾”。全球顾问是一家由工党前部长彼得·曼德尔森（Lord Peter Mandelson）联合创立的游说公司。该活动的目的是讨论癌症筛查和数据分析改进。帕兰提尔（Palantir）公司负责开发英格兰国民保健署3.3亿英镑的数据平台，是全球顾问的客户之一。

唐明接受了2月份晚宴的邀请，她将成为“荣誉嘉宾”。该活动由全球顾问组织，出席者包括来自帕兰提尔和其他组织的代表。大赦国际英国分支机构（Amnesty International UK）的商业和人权总监彼得·弗兰肯塔尔（Peter Frankental）对这种情况下的合同授予透明度表示关切。

英格兰国民保健署决定将3.3亿英镑的数据平台合同授予帕兰提尔公司，这一决定因其在隐私和合适性方面所引发的争议而备受关注。该公司的背景包括与国防、安全和情报部门的联系，并在新冠疫情期间成为关键的数据分析提供商。

唐明此前曾计划在2020年至2022年间参加全球顾问组织至少四个小组讨论会，其中两个是与帕兰提尔代表一起参加。英国官方游说注册册显示，全球顾问在2022年为帕兰提尔技术公司（Palantir Technologies）进行游说，但没有披露所涉及的特定问题或利益相关者。

帕兰提尔表示，参加网络活动对于与各个领域的专家建立联系至关重要，而英格兰国民保健署则强调了其对联邦数据平台合同采购过程公平透明的承诺。

 **Summary:**  
The NHS England senior official, Ming Tang, was a "guest of honour" at a dinner hosted by Global Counsel, a lobbying firm co-founded by former Labour minister Lord Peter Mandelson. The event aimed to discuss cancer screening and data analytics improvements. Palantir, the company responsible for developing NHS England's £330mn data platform, is among Global Counsel's clients.

Tang accepted an invitation to a February dinner where she would be "guest of honour." The event was organized by Global Counsel and attended by representatives from Palantir and other organizations. Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK’s business and human rights director, expressed concern over the transparency of contract awards in such situations.

NHS England's decision to award Palantir with a £330mn data platform contract was controversial due to concerns about privacy and suitability raised by NHS staff, medical trade unions, and privacy campaigners. The company is known for its ties to the defense, security, and intelligence sectors and became an essential data analytics provider during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Tang had previously been slated to participate in at least four Global Counsel-organized panels between 2n020 and n2022, two of which were alongside Palantir representatives. The UK's official lobbying register disclosed that Global Counsel lobbied for Palantir Technologies in 2022 but did not disclose the specific issues or stakeholders involved.

Palantir stated that attending networking events is essential to engage with experts across various fields, while NHS England emphasized its commitment to a fair and transparent procurement process for the Federated Data Platform contract.
