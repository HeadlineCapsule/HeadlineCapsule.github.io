以色列重启进攻，巴勒斯坦人被迫离开汗尤尼斯

# 简要新闻摘要翻译：

- 由于以色列重新发起进攻，成千上万的巴勒斯坦人已经从加沙南部城市汗尤尼斯疏散。以色列军队命令该市东部居民撤离，因为哈马斯火箭弹和武装分子的活动。
- 超过40万巴勒斯坦人听从了疏散命令，向西前往沿海“安全区”阿尔马瓦西或向北前往代尔巴拉赫市。以色列军方确认该地区医院无需疏散。
- 这次重新进攻是以色列对哈马斯持续战斗的一部分，此前于4月结束了在汗尤尼斯进行的为期5个月的行动。作为以色列官员所称的“低强度”阶段的一部分，针对加沙哈马斯部队的间歇性袭击仍在继续。
- 哈马斯在10月7日对以色列发动袭击时绑架了两名人质，现在确认这两名被绑架者在被俘期间死亡，他们的尸体仍被哈马斯扣留。目前仍有约120名以色列人和外国国民被绑架在加沙，其中超过三分之一被认为已死亡。
- 以色列代表团将前往多哈，与美国、埃及和卡塔尔调解人举行会谈，讨论可能的停火以换取人质协议。然而，由于以色列和哈马斯之间存在根本性分歧，谈判陷入僵局。
- 以色列总理内塔尼亚胡访问美国时表达了对拜登总统的支持，尽管拜登正在从新冠病毒疾病中康复，他们的会议被推迟了。内塔尼亚胡强调了以色列与美国在中东的强大联盟。

**要点：**
- 由于哈马斯火箭弹和武装分子的活动，汗尤尼斯居民**疏散**，以色列重新发动进攻。
- **人质危机**仍未解决，哈马斯确认两名被绑架者在被扣押期间死亡；在加沙剩余的120名以色列人和外国国民中，有三分之一被认为已死亡。
- 由于以色列和哈马斯之间的根本性分歧，**停火协议谈判**继续面临挑战。

 **Summary of Article:**

- Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have evacuated the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis due to a renewed Israeli offensive. The Israeli military ordered residents from the eastern edges of the city, previously part of an expanded "safe zone," to leave because of Hamas rocket fire and militant activity.
- More than 400,000 Palestinians have heeded evacuation orders, moving west towards Al-Mawasi coastal "safe zone" or north to Deir al-Balah city. Israeli military confirmed that hospitals in the area would not need to be evacuated.
- The renewed offensive is part of Israel's ongoing campaign against Hamas, following a five-month operation in Khan Younis concluded in April. Intermittent raids targeting Hamas forces across Gaza continue as part of what Israeli officials term the "low intensity" phase.
- Two hostages seized by Hamas during an October 7 attack on Israel were confirmed killed while in captivity, with their bodies still held by Hamas. About 120 Israelis and foreign nationals remain hostage in Gaza, over a third of whom are believed to be deceased.
- An Israeli delegation is set to travel to Doha for talks on a potential hostage-for-ceasefire deal brokered by US, Egyptian, and Qatari mediators. However, negotiations have stalled due to fundamental differences between Israel and Hamas.
- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the US amidst his planned meeting with President Joe Biden being postponed as Biden recovers from Covid. Despite this, Netanyahu expressed gratitude for Biden's support during the Gaza war and emphasized Israel's strong alliance with America in the Middle East.

**Key Points:**
- **Evacuation of Khan Younis residents** due to renewed Israeli offensive amidst Hamas rocket fire and militant activity.
- **Hostage situation** remains unresolved, with two hostages confirmed dead while in captivity by Hamas; over a third of the remaining 120 Israelis and foreign nationals believed deceased.
- **Negotiations for ceasefire deal** continue to face challenges due to fundamental differences between Israel and Hamas.
