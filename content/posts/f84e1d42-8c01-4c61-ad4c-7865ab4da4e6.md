科技股逆转将美股巨头推入修正区

**科技股逆转将美国龙头股推入修正区**

被称为“七雄”的七大科技巨头中，有四个从近期的高点下跌了10%以上，进入修正区。英伟达和特斯拉下跌17%，Meta（原Facebook）下跌14%，Alphabet（谷歌母公司）下跌12%。微软和亚马逊接近定义修正的10%下跌幅度，两家公司下滑约9%。

投资者对高估值以及是否能实现人工智能（AI）相关支出的预期收益表示担忧。尽管Alphabet报告了坚实的运营数据，但其最近130亿美元的季度资本支出几乎是去年水平的两倍，这引起了人们的担忧。

周三，科技股丰富的纳斯达克综合指数下跌3.6%，创18个月以来单日最大跌幅，本周收盘下跌2.1%。微软、Meta、苹果和亚马逊定于下周发布财报，这可能会考验投资者对推动市场收益的人工智能叙事的信心。

投资者表明了惩罚未达到预期公司的决心；特斯拉由于销售放缓和人工智能支出导致利润缩水而下跌12%，福特汽车的股价因保修费用超过预期而暴跌18%。未达到预期公司的股价平均下跌3.3%，高于五年的平均水平2.3%。

盈利季节与投资者“轮动”同步进行，他们正在从大科技公司中获利，青睐于可能受美联储9月降息惠及的小型公司。本周，小型股罗素2000指数上涨3.5%，而蓝筹股标准普尔500指数下跌0.8%。

 **Tech Reversal Pushes US Megacaps into Correction Territory**

Four out of seven technology giants, known as the "Magnificent Seven," have experienced double-digit declines from their recent peaks, entering correction territory. Nvidia and Tesla are down 17%, Meta (formerly Facebook) has fallen by 14%, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) is at a 12% loss. Microsoft and Amazon are close to the double-digit declines that define a correction, with both companies sliding about 9%.

Investors express concerns over punchy valuations and whether returns from significant artificial intelligence (AI)-related spending will meet early expectations. Alphabet's recent $13 billion quarterly capital expenditure raised worries as it was almost double the levels of a year ago, despite reporting solid operating numbers.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite experienced its worst one-day decline in 18 months on Wednesday, down by 3.6%, and ended the week with a 2.1% loss. Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon are set to release their earnings next week, which may test investor faith in the AI narrative that has been driving market gains.

Investors have shown they're prepared to punish companies missing expectations; Tesla lost 12% after slowing sales and shrinking profits due to its own AI spending, while Ford shares tumbled by 18% when warranty costs exceeded projections. Companies that missed expectations saw their share prices drop an average of 3.3%, more than the five-year average of 2.3%.

The earnings season coincides with a "rotation" among investors, who are taking profits in big tech names and favoring smaller companies likely to benefit from potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in September. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks added 3.5% this week while the blue-chip S&P 500 fell by 0.8%.
