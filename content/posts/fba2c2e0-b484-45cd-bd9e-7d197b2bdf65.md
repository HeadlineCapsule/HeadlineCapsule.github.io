激进投资者Cevian收购了Smith & Nephew的股份

**活跃投资者Cevian Capital** 收购Smith & Nephew股份 

这家伦敦上市的医疗器械制造商的股价跳涨，因为活跃投资者披露了持股情况，导致股值上涨7%。截至7月2日，总部位于斯德哥尔摩的Cevian持有该公司**5%**的股份。Smith & Nephew面临着各种挑战，例如供应问题和高管理人员更替率，在过去五年中已经换了三位首席执行官。

根据该基金合伙人弗里德里希·赫尔弗（Friederike Helfer）的说法，Cevian Capital认为可以通过提高运营绩效来创造显著的长期价值。这家富时100指数公司与股东保持开放的对话，并将继续与Cevian以及其他投资者接触。

Cevian之前曾长期投资于UBS、沃达丰和Aviva等公司，管理资产超过140亿欧元。这家瑞典活跃投资者通常针对具有复杂组织结构的公司进行简化。Smith & Nephew是体育管理和先进伤口管理领域的第二大公司，也是髋关节和膝关节假体制造领域第四大公司。

然而，由于供应链问题和影响绩效的管理层变化，其市值从2019年的170亿英镑下降到86亿英镑。今年，Smith & Nephew的增长缓慢，2024年第一季度的收入低于分析师的估计，预计全年销售额仅增长5-6%。

为了留住人才，该公司在最近的股东大会上批准将其美国首席执行官迪帕克·纳特（Deepak Nath）的薪酬提高30%，尽管有43%的股东投票反对这一计划。

 **Activist Investor Cevian Capital** takes stake in Smith & Nephew  

Shares in London-listed maker of medical devices jump as holdings disclosed by activist investor, leading to a 7% increase in stock value. Stockholm-based Cevian had a **5% stake** in the company as of July 2nd. Smith & Nephew has faced challenges such as supply issues and high executive turnover with three chief executives in five years.

Cevian Capital sees potential to create significant long-term value by improving operating performance, according to Friederike Helfer, a partner at the fund. The FTSE 100 company maintains an open dialogue with shareholders and will continue engagement with Cevian as well as other investors.

Cevian has previously taken long-term positions in companies including UBS, Vodafone, and Aviva, managing assets of over €14bn. The Swedish-based activist typically targets businesses with complicated organizational structures for simplification. Smith & Nephew is the second-largebest company in sports management and advanced wound management sectors, as well as the fourth-largest maker of hip and knee implants.

However, its market capitalization has fallen from £17bn in 2019 to £8.6bn due to supply chain issues and executive changes impacting performance. This year, Smith & Nephew experienced sluggish growth with revenue below analysts' estimates for the first quarter of 2024, expecting sales to grow by only 5-6% this year.

In an attempt to retain talent, it awarded its US-based CEO Deepak Nath a 30% pay rise at its most recent general meeting despite 43% of shareholders voting against the plans.
