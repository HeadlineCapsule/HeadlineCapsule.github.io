巴拉克·奥巴马支持卡玛拉·哈里斯竞选总统

**前总统巴拉克奥巴马和第一夫人米歇尔奥巴马支持卡玛拉哈里斯获得民主党提名**

前美国总统巴拉克奥巴马和他的妻子米歇尔正式支持参议员卡玛拉哈里斯竞选民主党总统候选人。奥巴马夫妇于周五通过视频通话表达了对哈里斯历史性候选资格的支持，并承诺将在选举过程中提供帮助。

他们的支持很重要，因为他们是最后一些尚未公开支持哈里斯的高级民主党人之一。乔拜登总统、比尔克林顿、希拉里克林顿、查克舒默、哈基姆杰弗里斯和南希佩洛西等其他知名人士也表达了对哈里斯竞选的支持。

奥巴马夫妇称赞哈里斯在美军历史关键时刻的远见、品格和力量。他们相信她拥有赢得选举并作为国家有效领导者的必要素质。如果成功，卡玛拉哈里斯将成为美国第一位女总统，也是巴拉克奥巴马之后的第二位黑人总统。

前总统和第一夫人的支持预计将团结民主党人支持哈里斯在11月大选中对抗唐纳德特朗普。

 **Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama Endorse Kamala Harris for Democratic Nomination**

The former US President, Barack Obama, and his wife, Michelle, have officially endorsed Senator Kamala Harris's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. The Obamas made their support known through a video call to Harris on Friday, expressing pride in her historic candidacy and pledging assistance throughout the election process.

Their backing is significant as they were among the last senior Democrats yet to publicly endorse Harris. Other prominent figures such as President Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and Nancy Pelosi have also expressed their support for Harris's campaign.

The Obamas praised Harris for her vision, character, and strength during a critical moment in American history. They believe she has the qualities necessary to win the election and serve as an effective leader for the nation. If successful, Kamala Harris would become the first woman president of the United States and the second Black president after Barack Obama himself.

The endorsement from the former President and First Lady is expected to unite the Democratic Party behind Harris's campaign against Donald Trump in November's election.
