特朗普否认与以色列领导人发生分歧，此前曾在马阿拉歌庄园会面

前美国总统唐纳德·特朗普和以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡最近在马阿拉歌庄园会面。在关系紧张的2020年年底之后，两位领导人试图淡化他们之间的任何紧张关系。在他们的联合亮相中，他们呼吁立即释放哈马斯扣押的人质，并强调了他们历史上牢固的关系。

他们的会议是在加沙持续冲突之际举行的，民主党总统候选人卡玛拉·哈里斯呼吁停火，并向巴勒斯坦人的苦难表示同情。这一立场引起了内塔尼亚胡右翼盟友的批评，包括以色列极右翼国家安全部长伊塔马尔·本-格维尔。

据报道，拜登政府距离达成停火以换取人质的协议非常接近，而这是一个几个月以来一直难以实现的目标。以色列总理内塔尼亚胡表示有望达成此类协议，并计划下周派遣谈判代表前往罗马，在那里还将举行会谈，参与者包括中央情报局局长比尔·伯恩斯、卡塔尔官员和埃及代表。

拜登总统旨在在10月底离任之前将其作为他遗产的一部分来确保停火协议。他一直在与约旦国王阿卜杜拉等地区领导人接触，以推动这些努力。以色列议会或以色列议会即将进入夏季休会期，这减轻了右翼联盟成员的压力，他们威胁说，如果达成协议，就会推翻政府。

前总统特朗普还呼吁结束加沙冲突，并承诺在回到白宫后，他将竭尽全力为中东带来和平。

 **Former US President Donald Trump** and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently met at Mar-a-Lago estate. The two leaders sought to downplay any tensions between them following a period of strained relations in late amoebas 2020. During their joint appearance, they called for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas and emphasized their historically strong relationship.

Their meeting comes amidst ongoing conflict in Gaza, with **Kamala Harris**, presumptive Democratic opponent to Joe Biden, calling for a ceasefire and expressing empathy towards Palestinian suffering. This stance drew criticism from Netanyahu's far-right allies, including Israel’s ultranationalist national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.

The **Biden administration** is reportedly close to reaching a ceasefire-for-hostages deal that has been elusive for months. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed hope in securing such an agreement and plans to send negotiators to Rome next week, where talks will also involve CIA director Bill Burns, Qatari officials, and Egyptian representatives.

President Biden aims to secure the ceasefire deal as part of his legacy before leaving office in late October. He has been engaging with regional leaders such as Jordan’s King Abdullah to further these efforts. The Israeli parliament or Knesset is set to go on summer break, reducing pressure from far-right coalition members who have threatened to topple the government if a deal is reached.

Former President Trump also called for an end to the conflict in Gaza and pledged that upon returning to the White House, he would make every effort to bring peace to the Middle East.
