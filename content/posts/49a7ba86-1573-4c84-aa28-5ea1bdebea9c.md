特朗普遇刺案后，美国特勤局面临压力

# 美国国会调查宾夕法尼亚州特朗普集会上的“不可原谅的安全漏洞”

**摘要：**
美国国会正在调查“不可原谅的安全漏洞”，此前在宾夕法尼亚州的一次唐纳德·特朗普集会上发生了一次暗杀未遂事件，这给负责保护总统和总统候选人的秘密服务局带来了压力。该事件引起了人们对该机构安全措施的担忧，并导致人们呼吁立即调查他们在事件中的作用。

**要点：**
- 国会对特朗普在宾夕法尼亚州的集会上的“不可原谅”的安全失误展开调查
- 秘密服务局局长金伯利·奇特勒可能被要求作证
- 联邦调查局和专家对枪手如何进入舞台区域感到惊讶
- 秘密服务为前总统、副总统、他们的16岁以下的孩子以及选举前120天的总统候选人提供保护
- 秘密服务发言人反驳了特朗普团队曾要求额外安保的说法；该机构在增加竞选旅行频率时增加了资源
- 拜登总统指示秘密服务为特朗普提供必要的保护，并审查即将举行的共和党全国代表大会的安全措施
- 秘密服务过去曾受到批评，包括1月6日国会山袭击事件中的作用以及对多样性、公平性和包容性政策的担忧

**安全措施：**
宾夕法尼亚州的集会事件突显了前总统或主要候选人参加的高知名度活动的安全规划中可能存在的弱点。秘密服务的作用包括提前侦察公共场地以确保安全措施到位，但仍然存在的问题是，枪手如何在集会期间接近特朗普。

**多样性和包容性担忧：**
一些共和党人暗示，秘密服务对多样性、公平性和包容性政策的拥抱可能导致了宾夕法尼亚州集会上的安全失误。这种批评并不是新的；之前人们曾担心这些努力可能会影响标准。

 **Summary:**  
The US Congress is investigating "inexcusable security breaches" following an assassination attempt at a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania, which has put pressure on the Secret Service responsible for protecting presidents and presidential candidates. The incident raised concerns about the agency's security measures and led to calls for immediate investigation into their role during the event.

**Key Points:**  
- Congress launches probe into "inexcusable" security failings at Trump rally in Pennsylvania.
- Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle may be called to testify.
- Surprise expressed by FBI and experts over shooter's access to the stage area.
- The Secret Service provides protection for former presidents, vice-presidents, their children under 16, and major presidential candidates within 120 days of elections.
- Claims that Trump's team requested additional security were refuted by a Secret Service spokespebroken; the agency added resources as part of increased campaign travel tempo.
- President Biden directed the Secret Service to provide necessary protection for Trump and review security measures for upcoming Republican National Convention.
- The Secret Service has faced criticism in the past, including its role during the January 6 Capitol attack and concerns over diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.

**Security Measures:**  
The incident at the Pennsylvania rally highlights potential weaknesses in security planning for high-profile events involving former presidents or major candidates. The Secret Service's role includes advance scouting of public venues to ensure safety measures are in place, but questions remain about how a shooter could access such close proximity to Trump during the rally.

**Diversity and Inclusion Concerns:**  
Some Republicans have suggested that the Secret Service's embrace of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies may have contributed to security failings at the Pennsylvania rally. This criticism is not new; concerns were previously raised about potential impact on standards due to these efforts.
