内塔尼亚胡的盟友攻击卡玛拉·哈里斯停火的呼吁

以色列右翼盟友批评美国副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯，此前她在本杰明·内塔尼亚胡访美期间呼吁以色列和哈马斯之间停火。

财政部长贝扎莱尔·斯莫特里奇指责哈里斯向哈马斯屈服，而国家安全部长伊塔马尔·本-格维尔则宣称“战争不会停止”。尽管受到这些批评，但美国官员仍然相信可以通过美国、埃及和卡塔尔的调解努力达成停火协议。

 **Summary**: 
Israeli far-right allies criticize US Vice President Kamala Harris after her call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the United States. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich accuses Harris of capitulating to Hamas, while National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir declares "there will be no halt to the war." Despite these criticisms, US officials remain hopeful that a deal can still be reached through negotiations facilitated by American, Egyptian, and Qatari mediators.

**Key Points**: 
1. **US Vice President Kamala Harris** calls for an end to the Israel-Hamas war during her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington D.C., expressing concern over Palestinian suffering in Gaza.
2. **Israeli far-right allies, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir**, criticize Harris's comments as capitulation to Hamas and a potential threat to Israeli hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.
3. **US officials remain hopeful for a ceasefire deal** despite delays in negotiations between Israel and Hamas, with talks expected to resume next week under American, Egyptian, and Qatari mediation efforts.
