米莱将在巴西会见博索纳罗，此前他与卢拉发生争执。

# 阿根廷领导人哈维尔·米莱（Javier Milei）与巴西前总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦（Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva）之间的外交纷争升级，因为米莱计划在两国领导人个人冲突之际访问巴西，并与右翼前总统雅伊尔·博索纳罗（Jair Bolsonaro）会面。这一冷遇发生在南方共同市场峰会召开前几天，由于两位领导人的关系紧张，阿根廷将不参加此次峰会。

## 要点：
- 米莱计划在圣卡塔琳娜州的一次保守派政治会议上与巴西右翼前总统博索纳罗会面，而不是与现任巴西总统卢拉·达席尔瓦会面。
- 双方最近发表的言论和社交媒体帖子重新激起了两位领导人之间的个人纷争。
- 阿根廷缺席即将举行的南方共同市场峰会，凸显了该集团的弱化状态及其对总统外交的依赖，也反映出米莱对加强与邻国关系不感兴趣。
- 巴西和阿根廷的关系因去年参与巴西利亚暴力反政府骚乱的巴西人寻求在阿根廷避难而变得更加复杂，巴西政府和最高法院将这些骚乱视为“企图政变”。

 **Article Summary:** Argentine leader Javier Milei's diplomatic feud with Brazilian ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva escalates as Milei plans to meet rightwing former president Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil amidst their personal conflict. This snub comes days before a Mercosur summit, which Argentina will not attend due to the strained relations between the two leaders.

**Key Points:**
- Argentine leader Milei is set to meet rightwing former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro at a conservative political conference in Santa Catarina, instead of meeting current Brazilian President Lula da Silva.
- The personal feud between the two leaders has been reignited by recent comments and social media posts from both sides.
- Argentina's absence from the upcoming Mercosur summit highlights the bloc's weakened state and its dependence on presidential diplomacy, as well as Milei's disinterest in strengthening ties with neighboring countries.
- Relations between Brazil and Argentina have been further complicated by the arrival of Brazilians seeking asylum in Argentina after participating in violent anti-government riots in Brasília last year, which are considered an "attempted coup" by the Brazilian government and Supreme Court.
