巴西银行家家族解决了数十亿美元的遗产纠纷

# 巴西萨弗拉银行家族解决了数十亿美元的遗产纠纷

长期的继承权争议已由已故亿万富翁约瑟夫·萨弗拉（Joseph Safra）的家人解决，他曾经是世界上最富有的人。这场纠纷涉及多个司法管辖区的法律斗争，包括纽约、日内瓦、圣保罗和伦敦。

## 阿尔贝托·萨弗拉退出家族企业帝国

约瑟夫的儿子阿尔贝托（Alberto）作为和解的一部分，同意退出这个王朝商业帝国的利益。他还放弃了其他家庭成员非法更改他父亲遗嘱的索赔，当他离开萨弗拉集团从事竞争性业务时，他们称之为“不忠和不感恩的行为”。

## 解决方案结束了漫长的法律斗争

该解决方案结束了全球各地办公室和法庭的跨司法管辖区法律斗争。以私人银行品牌为全球富人服务而闻名的萨弗拉家族，拒绝提供进一步细节，说明是否涉及经济补偿。

## 重新确认家庭纽带；独立追求商业利益

这个解决方案使萨弗拉家族的每一位成员都能独立追求各自的商业利益，同时分享彼此的成功。阿尔贝托将继续通过他创立的基金管理公司 ASA 开展业务，该公司是他与亲属之间的争议的核心。

约瑟夫·萨弗拉（Joseph Safra）于 2020 年 12 月 82 岁去世，以赞助艺术和慈善事业而闻名。这个银行王朝的起源可以追溯到奥斯曼帝国时期，当时他们为贸易车队提供资金。后来，他们在贝鲁特的塞法迪犹太社区建立了作为财富守护者的声誉。

萨弗拉家族控制着大量的金融企业，包括巴西的 Banco Safra、瑞士的 J Safra Sarasin 和纽约的国家安全银行。他们还拥有著名的房地产，例如伦敦的“小黄瓜”办公楼，并在香蕉种植者奇基塔（Chiquita）拥有 50% 的股份。

 **Brazil's Safra Banking Family Resolves Multibillion-Dollar Estate Feud**  
The longstanding inheritance dispute over the $25 billion estate of late billionaire Joseph Safra, once the world's wealthiest banker, has been settled by his family. The feud involved a legal battle across multiple jurisdictions including New York, Geneva, São Paulo, and London. 

**Alberto Safra Divests Interests in Family Business Empire**  
Joseph's son Alberto agreed to divest his interests in the dynasty's business empire as part of the settlement. He also dropped claims that his father's will was unlawfully changed by other family members when he left the Safra group for a competing venture, which they called "an act of disloyalty and ingratitude."

**Settlement Ends Prolonged Legal Fight**  
The settlement ends a multi-jurisdictional legal fight that had been waged in offices and courtrooms across the globe. The Safra family, known for their private banking brand serving wealthy individuals worldwide, declined to provide further details on whether there was a financial settlement involved. 

**Family Bonds Reaffirmed; Business Interests Pursued Independently**  
The resolution allows each member of the Safra family to pursue their respective business interests independently while maintainebly sharing in the success of one another. Alberto will continue his ventures through ASA, a fund management company he founded that was at the center of the dispute with his relatives. 

Joseph Safra, who passed away at age 82 in December 2020, had a reputation as a patron of the arts and philanthropist. The banking dynasty's origins date back to Ottoman times when they financed trade caravans. They later established themselves as trusted guardians of wealth for Beirut's Sephardic Jewish community.

The Safra family has significant financial enterprises under their control, including Banco Safra in Brazil, J Safra Sarasin in Switzerland, and the Safra National Bank of New York. They also own high-profile real estate such as London's "Gherkin" office tower and have a 50% interest in banana grower Chiquita.
