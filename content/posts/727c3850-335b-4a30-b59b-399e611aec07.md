特拉华州正在放弃保护投资者的传统方法。

# 特拉华州正在考虑一项新的立法，该法案将显著改变其保护投资者的传统做法，并可能对全球股东产生严重影响。

如果该法案获得通过，公司管理层将能够与大型股东签订秘密协议，在治理问题上绕过董事会，而这些问题以前是保留给董事会的。这种特拉华州法律的变化有利于控制性股东，破坏了管理层和公众投资者之间的平衡。

## 关键点：
- 特拉华州保护投资者的传统做法因新的立法而面临风险。
- 该法案允许与大型股东签订秘密协议，绕过董事会治理问题。
- 这种变化可能对全球投资者产生严重影响，并可能导致呼吁联邦干预。
- 特拉华州一直备受尊敬和影响全球公司法律。
- 拟议的立法偏离了该州对平衡的投资者保护的方法，这种方法随着大型机构投资者的影响力增加而逐渐发展。
- 批评人士认为，这种变化削弱了独立董事并削弱了特拉华州司法当局保护投资者的能力。

## 影响：
- 拟议的立法可能导致许多美国上市公司离开特拉华州，寻求其他司法管辖区的保护。
- 这种变化可能会促使其他州甚至联邦政府干预公司治理事务。

 **Summary of Article:**

The state of Delaware is considering new legislation that would significantly alter its traditional approach to protecting investors and could have serious consequences for shareholders worldwide. The bill, if enacted, would allow company management to make secret side deals with large shareholders, bypassing the board on governance questions previously reserved for directors. This change in Delaware law favors controlling shareholders over public investors and disrupts the balance between management and public investors.

**Key Points:**
- **Delaware's traditional approach to protecting investors is at risk due to new legislation.**
- The bill would allow secret side deals with large shareholders, bypassing board governance questions.
- This change could have serious consequences for investors worldwide and may prompt calls for federal intervention.
- Delaware's legal framework has historically been highly respected and influential in corporate law globally.
- The proposed legislation is a departure from the state'amoor approach to balanced investor protection, which evolved over time with increased influence of large institutional investors.
- Critics argue that this change undermines independent directors and diminishes Delaware's judiciary authority in protecting investors.

**Implications:**
- The proposed legislation could lead to a shift away from Delaware as the legal home for many US public companies, with investors seeking protection elsewhere.
- This change may prompt other states or even federal government intervention in corporate governance matters.
