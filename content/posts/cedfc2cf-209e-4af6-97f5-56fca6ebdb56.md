 **US National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) warns tech start-ups about security threats from foreign investors**

The US NCSC has issued a warning to technology start-ups regarding the potential risks posed by foreign adversaries, particularly China. The bulletin highlights that these adversaries may exploit private investments such as venture capital and private equity to gain access to sensitive data and intellectual property, which could threaten both economic and national security of the US.

**Key Points:**
- Foreign threat actors might use foreign investment opportunities in tech start-ups for espionage purposes.
- Hostile states like China may target struggling start-ups under the guise of due diligence before investing, to obtain proprietary data and intellectual property.
- Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have heightened concerns about Chinese security services' attempts at technology theft.
- The NCSC bulletin was developed with collaboration from various US government agencies focused on economic security and emerging technologies.

**Recommendations for Tech Start-ups:**
The NCSC advises tech start-ups to take precautionary measures, such as guarding critical assets and limiting data shared with investors, in order to protect themselves from potentially nefarious actors.
