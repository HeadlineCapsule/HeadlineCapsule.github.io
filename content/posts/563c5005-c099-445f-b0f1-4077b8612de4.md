欧洲担心与美国的安全关系会因唐纳德·特朗普选择了JD范斯而削弱。

**欧洲担心与美国的安全关系削弱，因为唐纳德·特朗普选择了 JD Vance**

唐纳德·特朗普选择极度孤立主义的 JD Vance 作为他的竞选搭档，加剧了欧洲的担忧，即第二个任期将大幅减少跨大西洋的安全联系，增加关税并切断美国对乌克兰的关键支持。这可能会对欧洲的国防和经济安全产生重大影响。

Vance 批评美国的安全保证使欧洲国家忽视了自己的安全需求，并认为美国对乌克兰的援助是不必要的。他的选择表明可能转向“美国优先”的管理，这可能会导致废除北约或减少美国在该组织中的领导地位。这可能会导致俄罗斯在中国的帮助下重新获得权力，对欧洲和乌克兰施加更多的胁迫。

欧洲国家还担心特朗普政府可能会增加关税，从而影响欧盟经济。此外，人们还担心Vance可能会提倡暂停美国对乌克兰的军事援助，与俄罗斯的要求一致，即基辅和平谈判并做出领土让步。

一些欧洲国家对特朗普第二个任期可能继续华盛顿和基辅之间的安全协议表示乐观。然而，总体情绪是担忧跨大西洋关系的削弱以及 Vance 影响下的美国外交政策的潜在转变。

 **Europe fears weakened security ties with US as Donald Trump picks JD Vance**

Donald Trump's selection of arch-isolationist JD Vance as his running mate has intensified Europe's concerns that a second term would drastically reduce transatlamoceanic security ties, increase tariffs and sever critical US support for Ukraine. This could have significant implications for Europe's defense and economic security.

Vance has criticized US security guarantees as enabling European nations to ignore their own security needs and argued that US aid for Ukraine is unnecessary. His selection suggests a potential shift towards an "America first" administration, which may lead to the abolition of NATO or reduced US leadership within it. This could result in Russia regaining power over a decade with China's support, applying more coercion against Europe and Ukraine.

European countries are also concerned about the impact on the EU economy due to potential increased tariffs imposed by Trump's administration. Additionally, there is worry that Vance may advocate for suspending further US military aid to Ukraine, aligning with Russia's demands for peace talks and territorial concessions from Kyiv.

Some European countries have expressed optimism about a possible second Trump term, hoping for continued security deals between Washington and Kyiv. However, the overall sentiment is one of apprehension regarding weakened transatlantic ties and potential shifts in US foreign policy under Vance's influence.
