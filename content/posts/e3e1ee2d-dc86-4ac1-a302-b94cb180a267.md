中国央行采取措施应对债券热潮

**中国央行在债券市场上干预以遏制牛市**

中国人民银行（PBoC）宣布计划直接干预债券市场，因为官员们对借贷成本降至20年来最低水平感到不安。根据周一发布的一份声明，PBoC打算“很快在公开市场上从一级交易商那里借入主权债”。

这一决定是基于对当前市场形势的谨慎观察和评估做出的，旨在维持债券市场的稳定运行。随着投资者在经济疲软时期寻求避险资产，中国10年期国债收益率下跌两个基点至2.18%，为彭博开始追踪数据以来的最低水平。

面对这种牛市行情，专家们认为PBoC正在通过出售债券和缓解需求来降温市场。中国社会科学院高级研究员张明预测，央行将成为未来二级债券市场上的活跃交易者。

在PBoC宣布后，中国10年期国债收益率上升至2.2%，30年期国债收益率上升至2.4%。央行此前曾警告说，对主权债券市场的过度热情可能导致类似于去年硅谷银行倒闭的危机。

两周前，在论坛上，PBoC行长潘功胜表示，该银行准备在二级市场上交易主权债券，强调这一行动不相当于量化宽松，而是作为基础货币注入和流动性管理的渠道。

 **China's Central Bank Intervenes in Bond Market Amidst Rally**

The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has announced plans to intervene directly in the bond market, as officials express discomfort with borrowing costs reaching their lowest levels in two decades. The PBoC intends to "borrow sovereign bonds from primary traders in the open market" soon, according to a statement released on Monday.

This decision was made based on prudent observation and evaluation of current market situations, with an aim to maintain stable bond market operations. As investors seek haven assets amidst a weak economy, China's 10-year government bond yield has declined two basis points to 2.18%, the lowest since Bloomberg began tracking data in 

In response to this rally, experts believe that PBoC is moving to cool down the market by selling bonds and easing demand. Zhang Ming, a senior fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, predicts that the central bank will become an active trader on the secondary bond market going forward.

The yields on China's 10-year government bonds rose to 2.2% following PBoC's announcement, while those for 30-year bonds increased to 2.4%. The central bank has previously warned that excessive appetite in the sovereign bond market could lead to a crisis similar to Silicon Valley Bank's collapse last year.

PBoC governor Pan Gongsheng stated at a forum two weeks ago that the bank was prepared to trade sovereign bonds on the secondary market, emphasizing that this action is not equivalent to quantitative easing but rather serves as a channel for base money injection and liquidity management.
