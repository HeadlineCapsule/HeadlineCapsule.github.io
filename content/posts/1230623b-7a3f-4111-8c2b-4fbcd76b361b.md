壳牌暂停在欧洲最大的生物燃料厂之一建设

# 壳牌暂停欧洲最大生物燃料厂的建设

最近，壳牌决定暂时停止鹿特丹的一个重大能源转型项目的施工。该项目旨在将废物转化为飞机燃料和生物柴油，但由于技术困难而推迟。最初计划于4月生产，该工厂的运营日期被推迟到“本十年后期”。

**延迟的原因：**
- 壳牌表示需要解决项目交付问题，并确保在当前市场条件下的未来竞争力，以此作为暂停施工的原因。
- 该公司计划对该项目进行减值审查，预计将在7月的季度结果中提供更新。

**市场压力：**
尽管生物燃料在欧洲能源转型中至关重要，但欧洲生物燃料市场一直受到供过于求的压力。公司匆忙生产，需求尚未显著增长。芬兰生物燃料专家Neste今年经历了股价大幅下跌。

**可持续燃料和战略：**
尽管出现延误，但可持续燃料仍然是壳牌战略的核心。该公司打算以“有节制和纪律”的方式花钱。生物燃料被认为比基于原油的燃料更可持续，因为它们在生产过程中通过植物吸收碳 dioxide 排放来抵消碳 dioxide 排放。

**鹿特丹工厂详情：**
位于壳牌珀尼斯炼油厂的鹿特丹工厂设计年产82万公吨生物燃料，原料为废食油和动物脂肪，并辅以经认证的可持续性植物油。该工厂每年可减少约280万吨二氧化碳排放，相当于从道路上移除100万辆汽车。

**项目设计和施工：**
壳牌委托沃利负责项目设计，并委托上海扬达工程公司在江苏省的工厂建造模块。

 **Shell Pauses Construction at Europe's Largest Biofuels Plant**

In a recent development, Shell has decided to temporarily halt construction on one of its major energy transition projects in Rotterdam. The project aimed to convert waste into jet fuel and biodiesel but faced delays due to technical difficulties. Originally scheduled for April production, the plant's operational date was pushed back to "the latter part of the decade."

**Reasons for Delay:**
- Shell cited the need to address project delivery and ensure future competitiveness given current market conditions as reasons for pausing construction.
- The company plans to run an impairment review for the project, with updates expected at its quarterly results in July.

**Market Pressures:**
Europe's biofuels markets have been under pressure from oversupply, despite their importance during the energy transition. Companeby rushing production, demand has yet to significantly grow. Neste, a Finnish biofuels specialist, experienced a significant drop in share value this year.

**Sustainable Fuels and Strategy:**
Despite the delay, sustainable fuels remain a key part of Shell's strategy. The company intends to spend money in a "measured and disciplined way." Biofuels are considered more sustainable than crude oil-based fuels because they offset carbon dioxide emissions through plant absorption during production.

**Rotterdam Plant Details:**
The Rotterdam facility, located at Shell's Pernis refinery, was designed to produce 820,000 tonnes of biofuels annually from used cooking oil and animal fats, supplemented by certified sustainable vegetable oils. The plant would have reduced emissions by an estimated 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, equivalent to removing a million cars from the road.

**Project Design and Construction:**
Shell commissioned Worley for project design and Shanghai Yanda Engineering for building modules at its factory in Jiangsu province.
