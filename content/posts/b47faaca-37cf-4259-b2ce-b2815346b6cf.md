华尔街乐观的收益预期为美国公司设定了高标准

# 华尔街的乐观收益预期为美国公司设定了高标准，因为它们旨在弥补科技部门的放缓。标普500指数股票预计将在6月底之前报告同比9%的收益增长，标志着自2022年初以来最大的季度增长。然而，随着估值达到近三年来的最高水平，如果收益未能达到预期，可能会令人失望。

## 关键要点：
- 标普500指数股票预计将在6月底之前报告同比9%的收益增长
- 估值达到近三年来的最高水平，引发了人们对收益未能达到预期可能导致失望的担忧
- 科技部门的放缓可能会影响整体市场表现；分析师认为能源和材料公司的强劲收益可以抵消科技收益增长的放缓
- 大科技股票（如英伟达、苹果、微软、亚马逊和Meta）的表现对市场情绪产生了巨大影响
- 当前水平的收益增长已经反映在目前的价格中，这可能会限制夏季市场上涨的潜力

 **Article Summary:** Wall Street's upbeat earnings expectations set a high bar for US companies as they aim to make up for tech sector slowdown. S&P 500 stocks are expected to report almost 9% year-on-year earnings growth in the three months to June, marking the biggest quarterly increase since early 2022. However, with valuations at their highest level in nearly three years, there is a risk of disappointment if earnings fail to meet expectations.

**Key Points:**
- S&P e500 stocks expected to report almost 9% year-on-year earnings growth for the quarter ending June
- Valuations at their highest level in nearly three years, raising concerns about potential disappointment if earnings do not meet expectations
- Tech sector slowdown may impact overall market performance; analysts suggest stronger earnings from energy and materials companies could offset slower tech earnings growth
- Market sentiment heavily influenced by the performance of Big Tech stocks such as Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta
- Earnings growth priced in at current levels may limit potential for a summer market rally

**Important Concepts:**
- **Earnings Growth**: The increase in profits reported by companies during the quarter ending June is expected to be significant. However, there are concerns that if earnings do not meet expectations, it could negatively impact stock valuations and market performance.
- **Valuation Levels**: Valuations for S&P 500 stocks have reached their highest level in nearly three years, which raises the bar for companies to deliver strong earnings growth. This increases the risk of disappointment if earnings do not meet expectations.
- **Big Tech Influence**: The performance of major technology companies such as Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta has a significant impact on market sentiment and overall stock valuations. Any fluctuation in their share prices can heavily influence the broader market.
- **Energy and Materials Companies**: Analysts suggest that stronger earnings from energy and materials companies could help offset slower tech sector growth, but there are concerns about limited potential for a summer market rally due to robust valuations.
