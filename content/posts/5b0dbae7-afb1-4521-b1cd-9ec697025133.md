鲁珀特·默多克的福克斯公司将在英国推出免费流媒体服务Tubi

# 鲁珀特·默多克的福克斯公司（Fox Corp.）在英国推出免费流媒体服务“Tubi”

由媒体大亨鲁珀特·默多克（Rupert Murdoch）拥有的福克斯公司（Fox Corp.）即将在英国推出其免费流媒体服务 Tubi。这个广告支持的平台将与 Netflix 和迪士尼等成熟的玩家竞争，进入英国拥挤的数字电视市场。

Tubi 计划在发布时提供超过 **20,000 部电影**和电视集数，包括《比利·艾利特》（Billy Elliot）和《环太平洋》（Pacific Rim）等热门剧集。该服务将提供来自迪士尼、NBCUniversal 和索尼影业等美国大型娱乐公司的内容，以及来自印度和尼日利亚等大型国际市场的原创制作。

Tubi 进入英国市场，是因为默多克现有的电视服务 TalkTV 在今年早些时候转型为数字平台。福克斯公司以 4.4 亿美元收购了 Tubi，由拉克拉恩·默多克（Lachlan Murdoch）监督交易。自推出以来，Tubi 已成为美国发展最快的流媒体服务之一，现在正在扩大到英国市场。

该服务将通过广告资助，而不是订阅或注册费。它旨在为观众提供多样化的内容，包括当地的英国节目以及来自宝莱坞和诺尔伍德（印度和尼日利亚电影业）的国际制作。Tubi 首席执行官安吉莉·苏（Anjali Sud）相信该平台将提供“更多样化的体验”，与竞争对手相比。

尽管进入竞争激烈的英国市场，观众可以访问许多美国流媒体服务以及 BBC 和 ITV 等免费公共部门广播，但 Tubi 对成功充满信心。该平台最终可能会播放福克斯的新闻和体育节目，从而进一步扩大其内容提供。

总之，鲁珀特·默多克的福克斯公司计划在英国市场推出广告支持的流媒体服务 Tubi，旨在通过提供多样化的电影和电视集数来与 Netflix 和迪士尼等成熟玩家竞争。

 **Article Summary: Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp to Launch Free Streaming Service 'Tubi' in the UK**

Fox Corp., owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, is set to launch its free streaming service Tubi in the United Kingdom. The ad-supported platform will compete with established players such as Netflix and Disney in Britain's crowded digital TV market. 

Tubi plans to offer over **20,000 movies** and TV episodes at launch, including popular titles like Billy Elliot and Pacific Rim. The service will feature content from major US entertainment companies such as Disney, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures, as well as original productions from large international markets in India and Nigeria.

Tubi's entry into the UK market comes after Murdoch's existing TV service TalkTV transitioned to a digital-only platform earlier this year. Fox Corp acquired Tubi for $440 million in 2e, with CEO Lachlan Murdoch overseeing the deal. Since its launch, Tubi has become one of the fastest growing streamers in the US and is now expanding to the UK market.

The service will be funded by advertising rather than subscriptions or registration fees. It aims to provide viewers with access to diverse content, including local British shows and international productions from Bollywood and Nollywood (Indian and Nigerian film industries). Tubi's CEO Anjali Sud believes the platform will offer "a more diverse experience" compared to its competitors.

Despite entering a highly competitive UK market, with viewers having access to numerous US streaming services as well as free public sector broadcasters like BBC and ITV, Tubi is confident in its prospects for success. The platform may eventually carry Fox's news and sports programming, further expanding its content offerings.

In summary, Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp plans to launch the ad-supported streaming service Tubi in the UK market, aiming to compete with established players like Netflix and Disney by offering a diverse range of movies and TV episodes funded through advertising.
