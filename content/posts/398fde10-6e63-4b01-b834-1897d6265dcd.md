年轻投资者博弈印度股票

# 印度的金融网红现象

**印度** 的 **金融网红** 越来越受到关注，他们通过在社交媒体上分享自己的投资经验和建议，吸引了大批追随者。这些网红中的一个名叫 **桑达尔** （Sundar），他在印度第一次全国性新冠疫情封锁期间开始拍摄 **期权交易** 视频，如今已经拥有超过 100 万粉丝。

桑达尔于 2007 年开始投资，最初投入 3万美元，现在声称由于他在期权交易方面的成功以及向初学者传授知识，他的净资产约为 1200 万美元。他收取 700 美元的培训费，并要求参与者至少有 1.2 万美元的资金，因为他认为那些无法承担市场风险的人不应该参与。

然而，桑达尔一直受到批评，因为他没有透露他的赢利交易细节和通过培训项目赚取的收入。印度 **证券交易委员会** （SEBI）对他和他的妻子出售每日看涨期权建议而未进行监管注册进行了调查。他们同意一年内禁止交易，但没有承认或否认违反任何法律。

这篇文章还强调了失败的交易带来的悲惨后果，一名 26 岁的软件分析师在输掉 1.2 万美元的期权交易后自杀。此后，SEBI 开始打击衍生品市场中的过度行为，并指示经纪公司包含有关期权交易风险的警告。

尽管采取了这些行动，但尚不确定这些措施是否会阻止印度年轻人冒险进入金融市场，因为该国机会有限。

 The article discusses the rise and impact of finfluencers in India, particularly focusing on one such influencer named Sundar who became an options trading guru after posting YouTube videos during India's first national Covid lockdown. With over 1 million followers, he has been seen as a role model for those looking to make fortunes in the market.

Sundar started investing in 200^7 with $30,000 and now claims his net worth is around $12 million due to his success in options trading and teaching novice traders. He charges about $700 for training sessions and requires a minimum capital of $12,000 from participants as he believes that those who cannot afford the inherent market risks should not participate.

However, Sundar has faced criticism regarding his winning trades and earnings through training programs. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) imposed a settlement order on him and his wife for selling daily call option advice without regulatory registration. They agreed to a one-year trading ban but did not admit or deny breaking any laws.

The article also highlights the tragic consequences of failed trades, with a 26-year-old software analyst committing suicide after losing $12,000 in options trading. SEBI has since engaged in crackdowns aimed at curbing excesses in derivatives and instructed brokerages to include warnings about the risks of options trading.

Despite these actions, it remains uncertain whether they will deter India's youthful market players who are willing to take their chances due to limited opportunities in the country.
