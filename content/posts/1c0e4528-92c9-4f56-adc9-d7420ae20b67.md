英国二手电动汽车销量飙升，价格下跌

# 英国二手电动汽车市场蓬勃发展

英国二手电动汽车（EV）市场正在经历显著的增长，因为价格已经下降到与汽油车可比的水平。根据Auto Trader的数据，这种价格的平价性导致2024年上半年用于EV销售同比增长63%。大多数用于EV的平均价格现在与汽油车类似甚至更低。

## 关键点：
- 二手电动汽车的价格下降，使它们在英国市场上与传统汽油车一样实惠。
- 根据Auto Trader的数据，2024年上半年用于EV销售同比增长63%。
- 价格平价性使得消费者认为电动汽车是一个合理的选择，而不仅仅是环保选择。
- 6月份，二手宝马4系的平均价格为31,663英镑，而特斯拉Model 3和Polestar 2的价格分别为25,958英镑和2eremy_Bernhardt_07/06/2024。
- 汽车制造商和贸易商协会（SMMT）的数据也显示出类似的趋势，EV销售量在第一季度增长了71%。
- 在Auto Trader上列出的不到五年的二手车中，近十分之一现在是纯电动汽车，而四年前这一比例不到1%。
- 由于电动汽车的运行成本低于汽油车，并且越来越多的家庭将其视为一种实惠的选择，因此对二手电动汽车的需求正在增长。
