工党的谈判代表将寻求塔塔钢铁公司的“就业保障”。

**工党对塔塔钢铁公司的就业保障承诺**

在最近的事态发展之后，英国新当选的工党政府表示，在关于国家支持计划的谈判中，它打算优先考虑塔塔钢铁公司的就业安全。商业大臣乔纳森·雷诺兹（Jonathan Reynolds）强调，“就业保障”将是英国最大钢铁制造商重组运营讨论中的关键要求，尤其是涉及威尔士南部的特尔塔勒姆厂。

工党已将就业保护确定为紧急事项，并正在积极与塔塔钢铁公司高管接触，以探索该公司旗舰设施未来的更好选择。前保守党政府曾同意一项5亿英镑的纳税人支持计划，其中包括投资7.5亿英镑建造一座电弧炉的计划——这是一种更环保但劳动力密集度较低的技术，可能会导致特尔塔勒姆厂的就业岗位减少。

雷诺兹拒绝透露工党将保证的确切工作数量，但他承认高炉比新技术雇用更多工人。该党的目标是确保劳动人民顺利过渡，并致力于通过其拟议的30亿英镑“绿色钢铁”基金投资钢铁业——该计划包括之前为塔塔钢铁公司商定的支持计划。

作为这项举措的一部分，英国钢铁公司也要求与塔塔钢铁公司类似的纳税人支持，以促进向更环保的生产方法转型。这家印度拥有的公司对与新部长的讨论保持开放态度，如果达成协议，可能会考虑投资新建加工设施。

 **Labour Party's Commitment to Job Guarantees at Tata Steel**

In the wake of recent developments, the UK's newly elected Labour government has expressed its intention to prioritize job security in negotiations with Tata Steel regarding state support packages. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized that "job guarantees" will be a key requirement during discussions about restructuring operations at Britain's largest steelmaker, particularly concerning the Port Talbot plant in south Wales.

The Labour Party has identified job preservation as an urgent matter and is actively engaging with Tata Steel executives to explore better alternatives for the future of the company's flagship facility. The previous Conservative government had agreed on a £500 million taxpayer support package, which included plans to invest £750 million in constructing one electric arc furnace—a greener but less labor-intensive technology that could potentially lead to job losses at Port Talbot.

Reynolds has declined to specify the exact number of jobs Labour would guarantee; however, he acknowledged that blast furnaces employ more workers than newer technologies. The party aims to ensure a smooth transition for working people and is committed to investing in the steel industry through its proposed £3 billion "green steel" fund—a plan which includes the previously agreed upon support package for Tata Steel.

As part of this initiative, British Steel has also requested similar taxpayer support as Tata Steel to facilitate a shift towards greener production methods. The Indian-owned group remains open to discussions with new ministers and may consider investing in new processing facilities if an agreement is reached.
