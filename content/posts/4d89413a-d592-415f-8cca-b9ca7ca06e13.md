乔·拜登表示，他正在“传递火炬”以拯救美国的民主。

**美国总统乔·拜登** 宣布了他不寻求连任美国总统的决定。他强调，这是为了“拯救美国民主”而做出的努力，包括将火炬传递给新一代领导人，并支持副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯竞选总统。

拜登计划在剩下的六个月内专注于国内和外交政策议程，同时倡导对**美国最高法院**进行重大改革。他认为这些行动对于维护民主至关重要，正如他所说：“拯救我们的民主，什么都不能阻碍。”

在民主党人中出现对拜登是否适合连任的猜测和恐慌之后，总统做出了这一决定。拜登承认政治领域需要新的声音，表示这是年轻领导人挺身而出的时候了。他还对哈里斯表达了信心，认为她是一位经验丰富、能力突出的领导人，能够引领美国前进。

拜登退出总统竞选，为卡玛拉·哈里斯和**唐纳德·特朗普**在11月的选举中展开激烈竞争奠定了基础，全国民意调查结果表明这将是一场势均力敌的较量。总统警告说，今年民主“处于危险之中”，并强调美国必须选择前进还是后退，选择希望还是仇恨，选择团结还是分裂。

在椭圆办公室的讲话中，拜登还确认了改革最高法院的计划，他称之为对民主至关重要。他打算完成剩余任期，继续致力于增强美国实力、保障国家安全和全球领导力。

 **President Joe Biden** announces his decision not to seek a second term as President of the United States. He emphasizes that this is an effort to "save US democracy" by passing the torch to a new generation, including endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris for the presidency.

Biden plans to spend his remaining six months in office focusing on domestic and foreign policy agendas while advocating for significant reforms to the **US Supreme Court**. He believes that these actions are critical to preserving democracy, as he states: "Nothing can come between saving our democracy."

The President's decision comes after weeks of speculation about his fitness to serve another term and follows a period of panic among Democrats. Biden acknowledges the importance of new voices in politics, stating that this is the time for younger leaders to step up. He also expresses confidence in Harris as an experienced and capable leader who can guide America forward.

Biden's departure from the presidential race sets the stage for a tight contest between Kamala Harris and **Donald Trump** at the ballot box in November, with national opinion polls suggesting a close race. The President warns that democracy is "at stake" this year and emphasizes America's choice to move forward or backward, towards hope or hate, unity or division.

In his address from the Oval Office, Biden also confirms plans for sweeping reforms of the Supreme Court, which he describes as critical to democracy. He intends to serve out the remainder of his term and continue working on America's strength, security, and leadership in the world.
