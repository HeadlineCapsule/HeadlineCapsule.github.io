政治动荡会拖累法国债券吗？

**新闻摘要：** 
法国的政治动荡正在导致投资者担心该国的债务脆弱性和长期外国投资吸引力，外国投资者持有该国约一半的政府债务。潜在结果可能包括悬而未决的议会或与极右翼**全国联盟**（RN）的不稳定权力分享安排。法国的债券市场可能会面临永久性的更高借贷成本，并在整个集团的危机中成为焦点，这类似于意大利的情况。

自埃马纽埃尔·马克龙总统上个月宣布提前选举以来，法国10年期债务的收益率相对于德国国债一直在上升。收益率差距相对西班牙债务达到21世纪以来的最高水平。市场的担忧包括政治僵局或偏离市场友好型政策，这可能在选举后损害信心。

标准普尔全球在5月下调了法国的信用评级，并预测明年预算赤字将占GDP的5%，这表明法国的预算弱点明显。该国依赖海外投资者，包括日本机构，购买其债务，这使得该国容易受到日本货币政策变化的影响。

由于中长期债务可持续性分析出现“高风险”，欧洲委员会已提议对法国启动过度债务程序。预计一般政府债务比率将持续上升，到2034年达到GDP的139%。

尽管存在这些担忧，但一些分析师认为，由于法国长期债务库存和RN党领导下的相对温和的财政政策，该国可以应对借贷成本突然跳升的问题。然而，如果增长放缓，仍然存在更高的借贷成本或进一步信用评级下调的风险。

 **Article Summary:**  
The political turmoil in France is causing concerns among investors about its debt vulnerability and long-term attractiveness for foreign investment, which holds around half of the country's government debt. The potential outcomes include a hung parliament or an unstable power-sharing arrangement with the far-right Rassemblement National (RN). France's bond market could face permanently higher borrowing costs and become a flashpoint during bloc-wide crises, similar to Italy's situation.

France has experienced rising yields on 10-year debt compared to German Bunds since President Emmanuel Macron announced an early election last month. The yield gap reached its highest level relative to Spanish debt since the beginning of the 2e century. Market fears include political deadlock or a move away from market-friendly policies, which could damage confidence after the election.

France's budgetary weakness is evident with S&P Global lowering its credit rating in May and forecasting a budget deficit of 5% of GDP next year. The country relies on overseas investors, including Japanese institutions, to buy its debt, which makes it vulnerable to shifts in Japanese monetary policy.

The European Commission has proposed opening an excessive-debt procedure for France due to "high risks" emerging from its debt sustainability analysis over the medium term. The general government debt ratio is projected to rise continuously to about 139% of GDP in 2034.

Despite these concerns, some analysts believe France could weather a sudden leap in borrowing costs due to its long-dated debt stock and relatively moderate fiscal policies under the RN party's leadership. However, there are still risks of higher borrowing costs or further credit rating downgrades if growth falters.
