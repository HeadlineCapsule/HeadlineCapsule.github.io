印尼当选总统计划大幅增加债务，首席顾问称

印度尼西亚候任总统普拉博沃·苏比安托计划大幅增加国家债务
- 我国领导人打算在增加税收的基础上，将债务与GDP的比率从39%提高到50%。
- 这一举措标志着即将离任的总统佐科·维多多谨慎的财政政策发生了重大转变，该政策使印度尼西亚成为大宗商品强国。

关键顾问哈希姆·乔霍哈迪库苏莫支持该计划并相信它可以保持投资级评级
- 普拉博沃的兄弟和著名巨头哈希姆表示，随着收入的增加，印度尼西亚仍然可以保持其投资级地位。
- 世界银行认为50%的债务比率对该国来说是谨慎的。

对经济和货币的潜在影响
- 经济学家警告说，达到5的群体比率可能会使预算赤字超过3%的法律上限，这可能会影响卢比，因为卢比今年已经对美元贬值了5%以上。

增加支出和创收的计划
- 普拉博沃政府旨在为学校儿童和孕妇提供免费午餐等雄心勃勃的计划，估计费用为280亿美元。
- 计划包括建造更多的发电厂、炼油厂、房屋、扩大粮食生产、建立国家收入机构、削减补贴并出售国有资产，以增加税收和政府总收入。

逐步增加债务水平的目标是实现8%的年度增长
- 根据哈希姆在雅加达的一次会议上所说，计划是每年将债务比率提高2个百分点，为期五年。

 **Indonesia's incoming president Prabowo Subianto plans a sharp rise in national debt**  
- The country's leader intends to increase the debt-to-GDP ratio from 39% to 50%, contingent on boosting tax revenue.
- This move represents a significant shift from outgoing president Joko Widodo's conservative fiscal approach, which transformed Indonesia into a commodities powerhouse.

**Key Adviser Hashim Djojohadikusumo supports the plan and believes it can retain investment-grade rating**  
- Prabowo's brother and prominent tycoon, Hashim, stated that with increased revenue, Indonesia could still maintain its investment-grade status.
- The World Bank considers a 50% debt ratio to be prudent for the country.

**Potential impact on economy and currency**  
- Economists warn that reaching a 5 groop_ratio may push the budget deficit beyond its legal ceiling of 3%, potentially affecting the rupiah, which has already depreciated by over 5% against the US dollar this year.

**Plans for increased spending and revenue generation**  
- Prabowo's administration aims to fund ambitious programs such as free lunches for school children and pregnant mothers, estimated at $28 billion.
- Initiatives include building more power plants, refineries, homes, expanding food production, establishing a state revenue agency, cutting subsidies, and selling state assets to boost tax collection and overall government revenue.

**Gradual increase in debt level with the goal of achuting 8% annual growth**  
- The plan is to raise the debt ratio gradually by adding 2 percentage points annually over a five-year term, according to Hashim's knowledge shared during a meeting in Jakarta.
