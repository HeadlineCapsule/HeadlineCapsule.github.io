乔·拜登发起新攻势以保持总统提名

**新闻摘要**

最近，乔·拜登总统发起了一场积极的努力，以维持他所在政党的总统提名。这一举动是在面临他自己民主党内的高级成员的批评之后做出的，他们呼吁他在一场表现不佳的辩论后退居二线。这场多管齐下的反击包括在国会山与关键选民群体接触、与左倾媒体机构接触以及与主要捐赠者联系。

拜登通过致信国会民主党人和全国电视出场，发表了一封充满挑战性的信息，声称他不会退缩，并将继续对抗特朗普的竞选活动。他还向试图让他退出比赛的党派精英表达了沮丧情绪。尽管《纽约时报》关于白宫 Parkinson 病专家到访的报道引起了人们对拜登健康状况的担忧，但他的医生发表了一封信，称自就职以来进行的神经学测试未发现帕金森氏症迹象。

在国会民主党人因假期休会返回华盛顿时，一些人正准备发起说服拜登退出竞选的努力。然而，在他的政党中也有人支持他，特别是在国会黑人核心小组的成员中。随着北约领导人抵达庆祝联盟成立 75 周年的峰会，拜登竞选连任的可行性将成为华盛顿讨论中的主导话题。

**要点：**

1. 乔·拜登在民主党高级人士呼吁他退居二线时发起了一场积极的努力，以维持他所在政党的总统提名。

 **Summary of Article**

In a recent development, President Joe Biden has launched an aggressive effort to maintain his party's presidential nomination. This move comes after facing criticism from senior members within his own Democratic Party who have called for him to step aside following a poor debate performance. The multipronged counteroffensive includes addressing key constituencies on Capitol Hill, engaging with left-leaning media outlets, and connecting with major donors.

Biden has issued a defiant message through a letter to congressional Democrats and national television appearances, asserting that he is not going anywhere and will continue his campaign against Trump. He also expressed frustration towards party elites who are trying to push him out of the race. Despite concerns about Biden's health raised by a New York Times report on Parkinson's disease expert visits at the White House, his physician released a letter stating that no signs of Parkinson's were found during neurological tests conducted since entering office.

As congressional Democrats return to Washington following their holiday recess, some are preparing to launch efforts to convince Biden to step down from the race. However, there is also support for Biden within his party, particularly among members of the Congressional Black Caucus. The viability of Biden's re-election bid will be a dominant topic during discussions in Washington as Nato leaders arrive for their 75th anniversary summit.
