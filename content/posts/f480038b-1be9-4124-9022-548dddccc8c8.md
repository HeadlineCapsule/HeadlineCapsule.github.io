民主党捐助者警告称竞选资金正在“枯竭”，而乔·拜登仍在坚持

**民主党捐助者警告竞选资金“枯竭”而乔·拜登仍在坚持**

- 一些富有的支持者越来越不愿意将现金倾注到“输掉”的努力中。
- 总统乔·拜登拒绝退居二线，威胁了该党11月大选中对抗唐纳德·特朗普的努力。
- 包括华尔街和好莱坞人物在内的捐助者表示，由于拜登坚定地决心留在比赛中，他们对筹款困难表示担忧。
- 尽管拜登总统最近作出了保证，但自他 مقابل特朗普的辩论表现不佳以来，捐助者的支持似乎在减弱。
- 拜登竞选活动面临着为之前被认为安全的州的选举战役提供资金的挑战。
- 竞选筹款对于摇摆州数百万美元的广告和地面行动至关重要，但正如特朗普在2016年战胜希拉里·克林顿时所展示的那样，并不能保证政治成功。
- 拜登成为第一位在美国选举中筹集超过10亿美元的候选人，而特朗普筹集了7.74亿美元；然而，从2023年1月到2024年4月，特朗普的竞选活动将其四分之一的捐款用于法律费用。
- 如果像乔治·克鲁尼这样的知名支持者继续他们的立场，要求拜登退出的呼声可能会增加。
- 一些民主党内人士警告说，除非拜登退出，否则该党风险在未来的选举中失去国会两院和白宫。

 **Democratic Donors Warn of Campaign Funds 'Drying Up' as Joe Biden Holds On**

- Some wealthy backers are increasingly unwilling to pour cash into a "losing" effort.
- President Joe Biden's refusal to step aside threatens the party's efforts against Donald Trump in November election.
- Donors, including Wall Street and Hollywood figures, express concerns about fundraising difficulties due to Biden'cuo determination to stay in the race.
- Despite recent reassurances from President Biden, donor support appears to be waning since his poor debate performance against Trump.
- The Biden campaign faces challenges financing election battles in states previously considered safe for him.
- Campaign fundraising is crucial for multimillion-dollar advertising and ground operations in swing states, but does not guarantee political success as seen with Trump's 2016 victory despite being outspent by Hillary Clinton.
- Biden became the first candidate to raise over $1bn in a US election, while Trump raised $774mn; however, Trump's campaign has spent about a quarter of its donations on legal fees from January 2023 to April 2024.
- Calls for Biden to drop out may increase if high-profile supporters like George Clooney continue their stance.
- Some Democratic insiders warn that unless Biden withdraws, the party risks losing both chambers of Congress and the White House in future elections.
