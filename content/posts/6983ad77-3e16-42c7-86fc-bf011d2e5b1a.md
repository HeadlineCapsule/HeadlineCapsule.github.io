大科技股光彩不再，美国市场因暴力轮动而动荡

**摘要：**
在最近的市场发展中，由于预期美联储会降低利率，大科技股失去主导地位，小市值股票大涨。自上周四以来，**罗素支付收入 2000** 小市值指数上涨了 7%，而“七巨头”科技巨头在全球半导体公司卖空潮中遭遇损失。

随着通货膨胀数据巩固了美联储 9 月降低利率的预期，投资者正在考虑其他部门和小型公司以寻求潜在收益。更广泛的市场轮动部分是由空头回补驱动的，被大量做空的股票成为表现最佳的股票之一。然而，尚不确定这种转变是否会给整体指数带来持续增长，或者投资者是否仍青睐“七巨头”。

**要点：**
1. 大科技股失去光彩，美国市场经历了剧烈的轮动，转向小市值股票和其他以前被忽视的部门。
2. 自上周四以来，**罗素支付收入 2000** 小市值指数上涨 7%，而“七巨头”科技巨头在全球半导体公司卖空潮中遭遇损失。
3. 投资者希望美国市场收益扩大，因为通货膨胀数据巩固了美联储 9 月降低利率的预期。
4. 市场轮动由空头回补驱动，被大量做空的股票表现最佳；然而，整体指数持续增长的不确定性仍存在。

 **Summary:**
In recent market developments, there has been a significant shift as Big Tech shares lose their dominance and small-cap stocks surge due to expectations that they will benefit disproportionately from an anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The Russell 지급소득 2000 small-cap index has jumped by 7% since last Thursday, while the "Magnificent Seven" megacap tech stocks have experienced losses amid a global sell-off in semiconductor companies.

Investors are now considering other sectors and smaller companies for potential gains as inflation data solidifies hopes of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. The broader market rotation has been partly driven by short covering, with heavily-shorted stocks among the best performers. However, it remains to be seen whether this shift will result in sustained growth for the overall index or if investors will continue to favor the "Magnificent Seven."

**Key Points:**
1. Big Tech shares lose lustre as US market rocked by violent rotation towards small-cap stocks and other previously unloved sectors.
2. Russell 2000 small-cap index jumps 7% since last Thursday, while "Magnificent Seven" megacap tech stocks experience losses amid global sell-off in semiconductor companies.
3. Investors hope for broadening gains across the US market as inflation data solidifies expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September.
4. Market rotation driven by short covering, with heavily-shorted stocks among best performers; however, sustained growth for overall index remains uncertain.
