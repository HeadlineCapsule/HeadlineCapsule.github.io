科技股光环消退，美国市场因剧烈轮动而动荡

**摘要：**
在最近的市场动态中，科技巨头股票经历了损失，因为投资者将重点转向小市值股票和其他以前被忽视的行业。自上周四以来，罗素2000只小市值股票指数上涨了7%，因为通货膨胀下降和盈利前景改善，而“七大”科技巨头股票在全球半导体公司卖盘的背景下下跌。

**要点：**
1. 投资者正在将资金从科技巨头股转移到小市值股票，他们认为小市值股票将更大地受益于预期中的美联储利率下调。
2. 自上周四以来，罗素2000只小市值股票指数上涨了7%，而“七大”科技巨头股票在全球半导体公司卖盘的背景下经历了损失。
3. 上周公布的通胀数据巩固了投资者对美联储9月降息的预期。由于负债水平高于大型股，小市值公司预计将从这一预期转变中受益更多。
4. S&P 500指数的同权重版本表现优于基准指数，上涨近3%，而市值加权版本下跌。
5. 市场轮动部分受到投资者头寸和空头回补的驱动，被大量做空的股票在最近几天成为最佳表现者。
6. 尽管小市值股票在过去一周获得了收益，但它们仍落后于基准S&P 500指数，使投资者对过于乐观保持谨慎。

**建议：**
1. 投资者应考虑通过将更多资金分配给预期中受益于美联储利率下调的小市值股票和其他以前被忽视的行业来实现投资组合的多元化。
2. 关注“七大”科技巨头股票的表现，尽管最近经历了损失，但它们仍可能带来积极的意外惊喜。
3. 随时了解通货膨胀数据和其他可能影响市场趋势和投资者情绪的经济指标。

 **Summary:**
In recent market developments, Big Tech shares have experienced losses as investors shift their focus to small-cap stocks and other previously unloved sectors. The Russell 2000 small-cap index has surged by 7% since last Thursday due to falling inflation and an improving earnings outlook, while the "Magnificent Seven" megacap tech stocks have fallen amidst a global sell-off in semiconductor companies.

**Key Points:**
1. Investors are diversifying their portfolios away from Big Tech and towards small-cap stocks, which they believe will benefit more significantly from an anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
2. The Russell amoeba index has seen a significant increase of 7% since last Thursday, while the "Magnificent Seven" megacap tech stocks have experienced losses amidst a global sell-off in semiconductor companies.
3. Inflation data published last week solidified investors' hopes for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Smaller companies, with higher debt burdens than large-caps, are expected to benefit more from this shift in expectations.
4. The equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 has outperformed its benchmark index, climbing almost 3%, while the cap-weighted version fell.
5. Market rotation is partly driven by investor positioning and short covering, with heavily-shorted stocks among the best performers in recent days.
6. Despite the gains of small-cap stocks over the past week, they still trail behind the benchmark S&P 500 index, leaving investors cautious about getting carried away.

**Recommendations:**
1. Investors should consider diversifying their portfoleby allocating more funds to small-cap stocks and other previously unloved sectors that are expected to benefit from an anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
2. Monitor the performance of the "Magnificent Seven" megacap tech stocks, as they may still present opportunities for positive surprises despite recent losses.
3. Stay informed about inflation data and other economic indicators that could impact market trends and investor sentiment.
