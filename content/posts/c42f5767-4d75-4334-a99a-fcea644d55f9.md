华尔街科技股第三天遭遇重挫

**摘要：**
周四，华尔街经历了第三天连续下跌，因为欧洲和亚洲的芯片股票出现大量卖出。尽管美国增长数据好于预期，但纳斯达克综合指数在波动性交易中收低0.03%，早间损失1.8%，随后上涨1%。

随着6月通胀数据下降，投资者对美国经济实现“金发女孩”场景（即在不引发衰退的情况下放缓通胀）的信心增强，因此继续从科技巨头转向小市值股票。罗素2000指数上涨1.3%，但标普500指数下跌0.5%。

英伟达和AMD等美国芯片制造商因令人失望的财报、地缘政治紧张局势以及向小型股票的转变而引领指数下跌，分别下跌1.7%和4.4%。欧洲科技股也出现大幅下跌，包括英国Arm Holdings（5.4%）和荷兰芯片制造设备制造商ASML（3.8%）。

欧洲和亚洲的急剧下跌标志着人工智能相关科技股热潮的逆转，而这一热潮曾推动了最近的市场上涨。美国GDP数据好于预期，达到4.36%，但未能阻止卖出潮，因为投资者对Alphabet等公司强劲的报告反应谨慎（下跌3%）。

德国芯片制造商英飞凌技术和BE半导体分别下跌6.5%和14%，而日本日经225指数下跌3%。日元兑美元的急升也加剧了市场波动，因为投机者匆忙退出涉及借入日元购买其他高收益资产的套利交易。

**要点：**
1. 尽管美国增长数据好于预期，但华尔街仍面临第三天下跌，因为欧洲和亚洲的芯片股票出现大量卖出。
2. 随着6月通胀数据下降，投资者对美国经济实现“金发女孩”场景（即在不引发衰退的情况下放缓通胀）的信心增强，因此继续从科技巨头转向小市值股票。
3. 令人失望的财报、地缘政治紧张局势以及向小型股票的转变导致英伟达（-1.7%）和AMD（-4.4%）等主要芯片制造商损失惨重。
4. 欧洲科技股也出现大幅下跌，包括英国Arm Holdings（5.4%）和荷兰芯片制造设备制造商ASML（3.8%）。
5. 美国GDP数据好于预期，但未能阻止卖出潮，因为投资者对Alphabet等公司强劲的报告反应谨慎。
6. 德国芯片制造商英飞

 **Summary:**
Wall Street experienced its third consecutive day of declines on Thursday due to heavy sell-offs for chip stocks across Europe and Asia. Despite better than expected US growth figures, the Nasdaq Composite index closed down 0.amoled by a volatile session with swings between early losses of 1.8% and subsequent gains of 1%.

The rotation out of Big Tech into small-cap stocks continued after lower June inflation figures boosted investor confidence in the US economy achieving a "Goldilocks" scenario, where inflation slows without triggering a recession. The Russell 2000 index rallied by 1.3%, but the S&P 500 closed down 0.5%.

US chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD led the index moves with losses of 1.7% and 4.4%, respectively, amid disappointing earnings, geopolitical tensions, and a shift to smaller stocks. European tech stocks also suffered significant declines, including UK-based Arm Holdings (5.4%) and Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML (3.8%).

The sharp declines in Europe and Asia mark a reversal of the frenzy over AI-related tech stocks that contributed to recent market gains. The US GDP figures, stronger than expected at 4.36%, did little to stem the sell-off as investors responded cautiously to strong reports from companies like Alphabet (down 3%).

German chipmakers Infineon Technologies and BE Semiconductor saw significant losses of 6.5% and 14%, respectively, while Japan's Topix index fell by 3%. The yen's surge against the US dollar also contributed to market volatility as speculators rushed out of carry trades involving borrowing yen for higher-yielding assets elsewhere.

**Key Points:**
1. Wall Street faced a third day of declines due to heavy sell-offs in chip stocks across Europe and Asia, despite better than expected US growth figures.
2. The rotation from Big Tech into small-cap stocks continued after lower June inflation figures boosted investor confidence in the "Goldilocks" scenario for the US economy.
3. Disappointing earnings reports, geopolebuilding tensions, and a shift to smaller stocks contributed to losses among major chipmakers like Nvidia (-1.7%) and AMD (-4.4%).
4. European tech stocks also suffered significant declines, including UK-based Arm Holdings (5.4%) and Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML (3.8%).
5. The US GDP figures did little to stem the sell-off as investors responded cautiously to strong reports from companies like Alphabet (-3%).
6. German chipmakers Infineon Technologies (-6.5%) and BE Semiconductor (-14%) saw significant losses, while Japan's Topix index fell by 3%.
7. The yen's surge against the US dollar contributed to market volatility as speculators rushed out of carry trades involving borrowing yen for higher-yielding assets elsewhere.
