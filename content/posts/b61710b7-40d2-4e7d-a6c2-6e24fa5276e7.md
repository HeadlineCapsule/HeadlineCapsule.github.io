Index Ventures 筹集了 2.3 亿美元资金以追求人工智能突破

**Index Ventures** 筹集23亿美元用于AI突破性进展 

风险投资公司专注于人工智能投资 

*Index Ventures*是一家风险投资公司，已筹集超过**23亿美元**的资金，以利用人工智能（AI）领域最近的进步。该公司相信，AI将重塑整个经济，由于技术变革类似于个人电脑、智能手机或云计算带来的变化，因此现在是投资的激动人心的时刻。

Index Ventures的合伙人**Jan Hammer**强调了这一技术时期的重要性：“过去一年或两年的特点是AI无处不在。”该公司支持Revolut、Discord和Figma等初创企业，从机构投资者那里筹集了**23亿美元**，计划将8亿美元分配给早期阶段公司，并将15亿美元用于对后期企业进行更大的投资。

根据该公司另一个合伙人Martin Mignot的说法，Index最近投资的超过一半都集中在AI领域。他们是欧洲最具价值的人工智能初创企业*Mistral*的早期投资者，还支持了*Cohere*和*Scale AI*。

尽管人们担心由于AI投资增加可能会形成泡沫，但Mignot认为，风险资本不仅仅关注价值，而是关注卓越公司的增长。他认为，即使这些公司一开始看起来很昂贵，但随着时间的推移可能会证明是无价的。

Index Ventures最近的筹款工作低于2021年的峰值，反映了当今初创企业面临的不同市场状况，尽管微软、亚马逊和谷歌等大型科技集团进行了重大投资。该公司仍然认为，在不直接与大科技公司竞争的领域存在增长空间，因为AI为建立新平台提供了机会。

筹款活动表明风险资本在经过两年的犹豫后出现部分复苏，寻求新资金的公司也表现出积极迹象。其他著名的公司，如Andreessen Horowitz和General Catalyst，最近也筹集了大量资金。

 **Index Ventures** raises $2.3 billion for AI breakthroughs  

Venture capital firm focuses on artificial intelligence investments  

*Index Ventures*, a venture capital firm, has raised over **$2.3 billion** to leverage recent advancements in *artificial intelligence (AI)*. The company believes that AI will reshape the entire economy and is an exciting time for investment due to technological shifts comparable to those brought by PCs, smartphones, or cloud computing.

**Jan Hammer**, a partner at Index Ventures, highlighted the significance of this period in technology: "The last year or two has been characterized by AI everywhere." The firm, which supports startups like Revolut, Discord, and Figma, raised **$2.3 billion from institutional investors** with plans to allocate $800 million for early-stage companies and $1.5 billion for larger bets on later-stage firms.

More than half of Index's recent investments have been in AI, according to Martin Mignot, another partner at the firm. They were an early investor in *Mistral*, Europe’s most valuable AI startup, and also backed *Cohere* and *Scale AI*.

Despite concerns about a potential bubble forming due to increased AI investments, Mignot argues that venture capital is not solely focused on value but rather the growth of exceptional companies. He believes that even if these companies appear expensive initially, they may prove invaluable over time.

Index Ventures' latest fundraising effort falls below their 2021 peak, reflecting a different market for startups today despite significant investments by major tech groups like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. The firm still sees room for growth in areas that do not directly compete with Big Tech, as AI provides a new platform to build upon.

The fundraising is indicative of a partial thaw in venture capital after two years of hesitation among firms seeking fresh funds. Other notable firms like Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst have also raised substantial amounts recently.
