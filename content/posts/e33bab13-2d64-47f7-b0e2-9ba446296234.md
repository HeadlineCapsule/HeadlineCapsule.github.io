软银收购英国芯片制造商Graphcore，推动人工智能发展

**软银收购英国芯片制造商Graphcore，推动人工智能发展**

日本科技巨头软银收购了总部位于英国的芯片制造商Graphcore，这是其推动人工智能（AI）发展的战略举措。软银由孙正义创立，收购专注于人工智能的初创公司Graphcore，使其与Arm一起成为软银投资组合的一部分。

Graphcore由英国半导体行业的资深人士于2016年创立，将与芯片设计公司Arm合作，成为软银在科技行业中的“下一个大举动”。这项交易预计将为Graphcore提供重要的资源和资本，使其能够与美国的芯片制造巨头Nvidia和AMD竞争，同时保持其总部位于布里斯托尔。

直接来自软银集团的投资（而不是其愿景基金）反映了这一收购对软银长期愿景的战略重要性。旧金山的执行官Vikas Parekh领导了这项投资，他强调了人工智能基础设施基础层的重要性，并预计随着更多参与者开发解决方案来参与这些市场，利润池将增长。

Graphcore在商业化其技术方面面临挑战，2022年销售额为270万美元，税前亏损2.05亿美元。交易金额尚未披露，但据报道刚刚超过6亿美元，低于该公司之前通过风险资本筹集的资金。

软银的收购符合其更广泛的战略，即将自己置于人工智能发展的中心，并支持Arm，这是一家总部位于英国的芯片设计公司，软银持有其大量股份。该交易获得了英国和美国政府的监管批准以及英国政府的国家安全批准。

Graphcore因美国对人工智能芯片的出口管制而退出中国业务，标志着其关注重点转向了美国和欧洲的人工智能客户，软银也最近在这些地区投资了超过10亿美元，用于英国的自动驾驶汽车初创公司Wayve。

总之，软银收购Graphcore代表了双方向前迈出的重要一步，因为他们联手推动人工智能技术的发展，与Nvidia和AMD等成熟企业竞争。

 **SoftBank Acquires UK Chipmaker Graphcore for AI Push**

Japanese tech giant SoftBank has acquired UK-based chipmaker Graphcore in a strategic move to advance its multibillion-dollar push into artificial intelligence (AI). Founded by Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's acquisition of AI-focused start-up Graphcore places the company alongside Arm within SoftBank's portfolio.

Graphcore, established in 2016 by UK semiconductor industry veterans, will join forces with chip designer Arm as part of SoftBank's "next big bet" in the tech industry. The deal is expected to provide Graphcore with significant resources and capital to compete against US chipmaking giants Nvidia and AMD while maintaining its headquarters in Bristol.

The investment, coming directly from SoftBank Group rather than its Vision Funds, reflects the strategic importance of this acquisition for SoftBank's long-term vision. Vikas Parekh, a San Francisco-based executive leading the investment, emphasized the critical role of foundational layers in AI infrastructure and anticipated growth in profit pools as more players develop solutions to participate in these markets.

Graphcore has faced challenges commercializing its technology, generating $2.7 million in sales with a pre-tax loss of $205 million in 2022. The deal's value remains undisclosed but is reportedly just above $600 million, less than the company had previously raised through venture capital funding.

SoftBank's acquisition aligns with its broader strategy to position itself at the center of AI advancements and support Arm, a UK-based chip designer in which SoftBank holds a significant stake. The deal received regulatory approval from both the UK and US governments as well as national security clearance from the British government.

Graphcore's exit from its China business due to difficulties arising from US export controls on AI chips marks a shift in focus towards AI customers in the US and Europe, where SoftBank has also recently invested over $1 billion in UK self-driving car start-up Wayve.

In summary, SoftBank's acquisition of Graphcore represents a significant step forward for both companies as they join forces to advance AI technology and compete against established players like Nvidia and AMD.
