 **Summary:**

A global IT systems outage caused by an update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affected numerous sectors worldwide on Friday. The disruption impacted financial services, transportation (including airlines and airports), media companies, consumer businesses, sports organizations, healthcare providers, and more.

**Financial Services:**
- Global banks, brokers, and fintech firms such as JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Bloomebox, and ION Group experienced system access issues that hindered trade processing capabilities. The London Stock Exchange's news service was also temporarily unavailable.

**Transportation:**
- Airlines faced significant disruptions in flight schedules due to the outage affecting multiple systems like aircraft weight calculation, customer check-in, and call center operations. This led to thousands of flight cancellations across various regions including the US, UK, India, Australia, and more. Some airlines such as KLM temporarily suspended operations while others continued operating with delays.

**Media, Consumer, and Sports:**
- Sky News in the UK had to suspend live TV broadcasting for a period on Friday morning but resumed later. Manchester United delayed ticket releases due to the outage affecting their systems. The Paris Olympic Games organizers also reported IT disruptions just before hosting millions of visitors.

**Healthcare:**
- In the UK, many GP practices were impacted by an issue with EMIS, a patient record system, leading them to resort to non-digital communication methods and service provision. German hospital network Schleswig-Holstein had to cancel elective operations and close walk-in clinics, while Mass General Brigham in the US canceled all non-urgent surgical procedures and medical appointments.

**CrowdStrike's Response:**
- CrowdStrike acknowledged that a content update for Windows hosts was responsible for bringing down IT systems globally but assured customers of their support during recovery efforts. The company stated, "This is not a security incident or cyber attack."

**Market Impact:**
- Microsoft and CrowdStrike's stock prices experienced slight declines in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange following the outage news.
