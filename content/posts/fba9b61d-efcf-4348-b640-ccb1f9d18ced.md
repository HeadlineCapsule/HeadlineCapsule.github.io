全球公司受微软停机影响

# 全球 IT 中断事件影响多个行业

**金融服务：**
- 全球银行、经纪公司和金融科技公司，如摩根大通、瑞银、Bloomebox 和 ION 集团，由于停机而出现系统访问问题。伦敦证券交易所的交易场所未受影响，但其新闻服务在当天稍后恢复之前面临中断。

**交通运输：**
- 联合航空、英国航空和瑞安航空等航空公司报告航班取消和延误，原因是停机导致的系统故障。中断发生在一年中交通最繁忙的时刻之一，全球数以千计的航班受到影响。KLM 等机场暂时停止运营，因为他们发现“无法处理航班”。

**媒体、消费者和体育：**
- 英国天空新闻台因停机而暂停节目播出，但在周五上午后来恢复广播。曼联由于微软服务器的问题推迟了比赛门票的 sale，巴黎奥运会组委会也报告了 IT 中断事件，距离接待数百万访客只有一个星期的时间。

**医疗保健：**
- 英国全科医生行医实践在沟通患者和提供服务方面遇到困难，原因是 EMIS 预约和患者记录系统出现问题。德国什勒斯维希-霍尔斯坦州医院取消了选定手术，马萨诸塞州总医院推迟了非紧急手术和医疗预约。

**CrowdStrike 的回应：**
该网络安全公司表示，中断是由 Windows 主机单个内容更新中的缺陷引起的。他们向客户保证将提供恢复支持，并强调这不是安全事件或网络攻击。

 **Summary:**

A global IT outage caused by an update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affected various sectors worldwide on Friday. The disruption impacted financial services, transportation (including airlines and airports), media companies, consumer businesses, sports organizations, and healthcare facilities.

**Financial Services:**
- Global banks, brokers, and fintech firms such as JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Bloomebox, and ION Group experienced system access issues due to the outage. The London Stock Exchange's trading venue was unaffected but its news service faced interruptions before being restored later in the day.

**Transportation:**
- Airlines such as United, British Airways, and Ryanair reported flight cancellations and delays due to system failures caused by the outage. The disruption occurred during one of the busiest travel times of the year, affecting thousands of flights globally. Some airports like KLM temporarily suspended operations as they found it "impossible to handle flights."

**Media, Consumer and Sport:**
- Sky News in the UK had to suspend programming due to the outage but resumed broadcasting later on Friday morning. Manchester United delayed ticket releases for its matches because of issues with Microsoft Servers. The Paris Olympic Games organizers also reported IT disruptions just a week before hosting millions of visitors.

**Health:**
- UK GP practices faced difficulties in communicating with patients and providing services due to an issue with the EMIS appointment and patient record system. German hospital Schleswig-Holstein had to cancel elective operations, while Mass General Brigham in Massachusetts postponed non-urgent surgical procedures and medical appointments.

**CrowdStrike's Response:**
The cybersecurity firm stated that the outage was caused by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. They assured customers of their support to assist with recovery, emphasizing that it was not a security incident or cyber attack.
