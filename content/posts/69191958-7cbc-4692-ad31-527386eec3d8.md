西班牙总理佩德羅·桑切斯因妻子受贿指控而被传唤作证

# 西班牙首相被传唤作证

**西班牙首相佩德罗·桑切斯** 因妻子贝戈尼亚·戈麦斯（Begoña Gómez）涉嫌贪污腐败而被传唤作证。此案涉及影响交易和与她商业交易相关的腐败指控。尚未提出指控。

法官胡安·卡洛斯·佩伊纳多（Juan Carlos Peinado）决定，考虑到调查戈麦斯与当局之间可能存在的关系，让桑切斯在7月10日在其官邸作为证人作证是“有用的”。这一决定加剧了桑切斯所称的右翼针对他的抹黑运动。

该调查已经在西班牙政治界造成了紧张局势，并在去年桑切斯通过无果的大选重返权力后变得更加严重。该案由具有极端右翼背景的手足联盟（Manos Limpias）提出投诉触发，该组织以发起具有政治色彩的法律案件而闻名。

桑切斯的办公室没有对此事发表评论。桑切斯领导的社会主义政府副首相约兰达·迪亚兹（Yolanda Díaz）对这一情况表示惊讶。人民党（PP）的博尔哈·塞佩尔（Borja Sémper）批评了桑切斯，并说西班牙人对这一“永久丑闻”感到羞耻。

上次西班牙现任首相被传唤在司法案件中作证是在2017年，当时来自人民党的马里亚诺·拉霍伊（Mariano Rajoy）面临腐败指控。目前担任人民党领袖的阿尔贝托·努尼亚·费伊乔（Alberto Núñez Feijóo）建议桑切斯也应该辞职。

桑切斯否认妻子有任何不法行为，并在本月的一次电台采访中表示他不会被击败。他还提到，戈麦斯已经提交了几项上诉，要求法官澄清为什么她被传唤作证，这些上诉尚未得到答复。

 **Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez** called to testify over graft allegations against his wife, Begoña Gómez. The case involves accusations of influence peddling and corruption related to her business dealings. No charges have been filed yet. 

Judge Juan Carlos Peinado has decided that it is **useful** for Sánchez to testify as a witness at his official residence on July amo, considering the need to investigate Gómez's possible relationship with authorities. This decision raises the stakes in what Sánchez describes as part of a rightwing smear campaign against him.

The investigation has caused tension within Spanish politics and worsened after Sánchez returned to power following an inconclusive general election last year. The case was triggered by a complaint from Manos Limpias, a group with far-right links known for launching politically charged legal cases.

Sánchez's office did not respond to requests for comment on the matter. Yolanda Díaz, deputy prime minister in Sánchez's Socialist-led government, expressed astonishment at the situation. Borja Sémper of the conservative People's Party (PP) criticized Sánchez and said that Spaniards are ashamed of this "permanent scandal."

The last time a sitting Spanish prime minister was summoned to testify in a judicial case was in 2017, when Mariano Rajoy from the PP faced corruption charges. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, current PP leader, suggested that Sánchez should resign as well.

Sánchez has denied any wrongdoing by his wife and stated that he will not be broken in a radio interview this month. He also mentioned that Gómez had filed several appeals asking the judge to clarify why she was summoned to testify, which are yet to be answered.
