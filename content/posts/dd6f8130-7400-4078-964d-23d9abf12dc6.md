委内瑞拉独裁领导人尼古拉斯·马杜罗宣布选举获胜者

**摘要：**
委内瑞拉独裁领导人尼古拉斯·马杜罗（Nicolás Maduro）被国家控制的全国选举委员会（CNE）宣布为星期日总统投票的获胜者。反对派及其支持者对计票中的严重违规行为表示关切。尽管民意调查和快速计票预测反对派将获得大胜，但马杜罗在80%的选票统计完后获得了51.2%的选票，而他的主要竞争对手埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯（Edmundo González）则获得了44.2%。

马杜罗的胜利得到了古巴和尼加拉瓜的祝贺，但作为代理候选人为冈萨雷斯竞选的主要反对派领袖玛丽亚·科里纳·马查多（María Corina Machado）声称，她的办公室审查了选票，显示冈萨雷斯是委内瑞拉合法总统，获得了70%的选票。反对派还指控CNE从投票中心移除他们的观察员，并在某些情况下拒绝传达结果。

双方都认为这次选举是委内瑞拉的一个转折点，该国由于政府管理不善和美国的制裁而面临经济崩溃。马杜罗指责美国干涉选举，并指控他的对手密谋反对他。拜登政府表示担心宣布的结果并不反映委内瑞拉人民的意志或选票。

**要点：**
- 国家控制的全国选举委员会（CNE）宣布尼古拉斯·马杜罗获胜

 **Summary:**
Venezuela's authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, was declared the winner of Sunday's presidential vote by the state-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE). The opposition and their supporters have raised concerns about serious irregularities in the count. Despite predictions from opinion polls and quick counts that favored a big win for the opposition, Maduro secured 51.2% of votes with 80% counted while his main challenger, Edmundo González, had 44.2%.

Maduro's victory was met with congratulations from Cuba and Nicaragua, but María Corina Machado, the main opposition leader who ran as a surrogate candidate for González, claimed that her office reviewed ballots showing González as Venezuela's legitimate president with 70% of votes. The opposition also accused the CNE of removing their witnesses from voting centers and refusing to transmit results in some cases.

Both sides viewed this election as a turning point for Venezuela, which has been facing economic collapse due to government mismanagement and US sanctions. Maduro blamed the US for meddling in the elections and accused his opponents of plotting against him. The Biden administration expressed concerns that the announced result does not reflect the will or votes of the Venezuelan people.
