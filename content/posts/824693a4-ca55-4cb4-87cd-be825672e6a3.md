高盛利润翻番至30亿美元，交易量回升

**高盛** 的利润在第二季度超过了30亿美元，因为交易表现超出预期，交易量回升。这家美国投资银行的利润增长了150%，达到28亿美元，高于分析师预测的26亿美元，也高于上年同期的19亿美元。这种增长是由于交易活动在经过两年低迷后加速复苏，这是因为各国央行为了控制通货膨胀而提高利率。

**高盛** 的债券和股票交易员表现优于预期，为银行强劲的成绩做出了贡献。首席执行官大卫·所罗门（David Solomon）指出，交易活动的积压量“显著增加”，表明资本市场和并购活动正在早期阶段复苏。尽管仍低于10年平均水平，但私募股权交易活动预计将继续加快步伐。

由于预期合并和收购以及债务交易将反弹，高盛的股价今年上涨了25%，超过了KBW银行指数（13%的上涨）和标准普尔500指数（18%的上涨）。投资银行收入在第二季度增长了21%，达到17亿美元，但落后于摩根大通公司报告的50%的增长。

固定收益交易收入增长17%至32亿美元，而股票交易收入同比增长7%至32亿美元。这两个业务部门的表现都优于分析师的预测。资产和财富管理部门在当季报告了27%的收入增长，税前利润率达到23%。

总之：
- 高盛第二季度利润翻了一番，达到30亿美元，因为交易活动加速复苏。
- 债券和股票交易员表现优于预期，为银行强劲的成绩做出了贡献。
- 投资银行收入增长了21%，但落后于摩根大通等其他关键要点：
- 高盛的股价今年上涨了25%，因为市场预期合并和收购以及债务交易将反弹。
- 资产和财富管理部门报告了显著的收入增长，税前利润率接近目标范围。

 **Goldman Sachs**' profits more than doubled to $3 billion in Q2 as dealmaking recovers and trading performance exceeded expectations. The US investment bank saw a 150% increase in profits, surpassing analyst predictions of $2.8 billion and up from $1.n billion the previous year. This growth was driven by an accelerating recovery in dealmaking activity after two years of sluggishness due to central banks raising interest rates to combat inflation.

CEO David Solomon noted that the backlog for deal activity was "up significantly," indicating an early stage of a capital markets and M&A recovery.

Investment banking revenues rose 21% to $1.7 billion in Q2 but lagged behind JPMorgan Chase's reported increase of 50%.
