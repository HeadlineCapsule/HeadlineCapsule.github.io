阿迪达斯因以色列批评而取消贝拉·哈迪德的广告活动

阿迪达斯因以色列的批评而将贝拉·哈迪德从活动中撤下

 - 阿迪达斯已删除模特贝拉·哈迪德的广告图片，她正在推广与1972年慕尼黑奥运会有关的一款运动鞋。在以色列政府对哈迪德的巴勒斯坦血统提出指责并指控其反犹太主义后，阿迪达斯做出了这一决定。
- 争议源于哈迪德据称使用了呼吁消除以色列的口号：“从河到海——巴勒斯坦将自由。”这一声明与她推广的阿迪达斯SL 72鞋有关，该鞋最初在慕尼黑奥运会期间推出，当时有11名以色列团队成员被杀。
- 包括以色列大使馆和像StopAntisemitism这样的亲犹太团体在内的各个来源都对该活动提出了批评。针对这些担忧，阿迪达斯宣布将修订其剩余的活动，但没有提供有关所做更改的具体细节。
- 因此，哈迪德推广SL 72的图片已被从社交媒体平台上删除。然而，展示品牌大使朱尔斯·昆德（法国足球运动员）、A$AP Nast（美国说唱歌手）和萨布里娜·兰（中国模特）的其他图片仍在线。
- 阿迪达斯就该活动可能造成的任何冒犯或不安表示歉意，并承认对悲惨的历史事件无意联系。该公司还强调了通过销售剩余的Yeezy鞋（与说唱歌手坎耶·韦斯特的合作）的捐款来打击反犹太主义和仇恨言论的承诺。
- 这一事件突显了阿迪达斯持续努力与坎耶·韦斯特相关的争议保持距离，包括由于他的反犹太言论而在2022年结束合作伙伴关系。

 **Adidas** pulls Bella Hadid from campaign after Israeli criticism  

- Adidas has removed advertising images featuring model **Bella Hadid** promoting a sports shoe linked to the 1972 Munich Olympics. The decision came following public outcry and accusations of antisemitism by the Israeli government against Hadid, who is known for her Palestinian roots.
- The controversy arose from Hadid's alleged use of a slogan calling for the elimination of Israel: "From the river to the sea — Palestine will be free." This statement was made in connection with her promotion of Adidas' **SL 72** shoe, which first launched during the Munich Olympics where 11 Israeli team members were killed.
- The campaign faced criticism from various sources, including Israel’s embassy and pro-Jewish groups like StopAntisemitism. In response to these concerns, Adidas announced that it would be revising the remainder of its campaign but did not provide specific details on changes made.
- As a result of this incident, images featuring Hadid promoting the SL 72 have been removed from social media platforms. However, other images showcasing brand ambassadors such as **Jules Koundé** (French footballer), **A$AP Nast** (US rapper), and **Sabrina Lan** (Chinese model) remain online.
- Adidas issued an apology for any upset or distress caused by the campaign, acknowledging that connections to tragic historical events were unintentional. The company also emphasized its commitment to fighting antisemitism and hate speech through donations from sales of remaining Yeezy shoes (a collaboration with rapper Kanye West).
- This incident highlights Adidas' ongoing efforts to distance itself from controversies involving **Kanye West**, including ending their partnership in 2n22 due to his antisemitic remarks.
