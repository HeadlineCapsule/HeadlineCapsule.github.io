华尔街银行押注英镑将延续赢利势头

# 华尔街银行押注英镑持续走强

**摘要：** 华尔街银行因英国经济韧性、顽固通货膨胀和政治稳定（在工党选举胜利后）而押注英镑持续走强。英镑是今年表现最佳的主要发达市场货币，分析师预测其将继续上涨，对抗美元和欧元。

**要点：**

1. **英镑表现：** 英镑目前处于2016年脱欧公投以来的最高水平，今年上涨了1.7%，达到每美元1.29，对欧元也上涨了近3%。
2. **经济因素：** 英镑上涨的原因是英国经济增长超预期和顽固的通货膨胀，这可能会阻止英格兰银行（BoE）采取激进的降息措施。
3. **政治稳定：** 工党的选举胜利让投资者对结束之前动荡的政治局势充满了乐观情绪，这对英镑有利。英国现在被认为是G7国家中最政治稳定的国家，这对市场和货币 sentiment 产生了积极影响。
4. **分析师预测：** 摩根大通预测英镑将在明年3月达到每美元1.35，高盛则预计其长期上涨。花旗集团的策略师也看好英镑，预测其将首次达到脱欧以来的0.82英镑/欧元的高点。
5. **货币投机：** 货币投机者对英镑上涨的押注达到了1988年有记录以来的最高水平，反映了日益增长的乐观情绪。
6. **英国经济前景：** 尽管利率上升到5.25%，但英国已摆脱了轻微的衰退，5月经济增长速度是预期的两倍，服务业通胀仍然很高。这增强了英格兰银行在8月1日下次会议上不会降息的信心。
7. **与其他市场相比：** 英国的经济势头与美国形成对比，美国市场加大了对9月降息的押注，因为劳动力市场正在走弱。
8. **潜在挑战：** 一些分析师指出，英镑仍比脱欧前下跌了4%，如果英格兰银行今年晚些时候与其他中央银行一起降息，进一步上涨可能更加困难。

 **Summary:** Wall Street banks are betting on the British pound's continued strength due to resilient economic growth, stubborn inflation, and political stability following Labour's election victory. The pound has been the best-performing major developed market currency this year, with analysts forecasting further gains against both the dollar and euro.

**Key Points:**
1. **British Pound Performance:** Sterling is currently at its strongest level since the 201amo referendum, climbing 1.7% against a strong dollar to $1.29 and nearly 3% against the euro this year.
2. **Economic Factors:** The pound's gains are fueled by better-than-expected growth and stubborn inflation, which may prevent aggressive interest rate cuts from the Bank of England (BoE).
3. **Political Stability:** Labour's election victory has raised optimism among investors for an end to volatile politics that previously buffeted sterling. The UK is now considered the most politically stable country in the G7, which positively impacts markets and currency sentiment.
4. **Analyst Forecasts:** JPMorgan forecasts sterling will reach $1.35 by March next year, while Goldman Sachs expects it to climb on a long-term view. Citi strategists are bullish on the pound, predicting it will strengthen to £0.82 per euro for the first time since Brexit in 2016.
5. **Currency Speculation:** Growing optimism is reflected by currency speculators' wagers on a rise in sterling, which have reached their highest level in records dating back to 1988.
6. **UK Economic Outlook:** Despite raising interest rates to 5.25%, the UK has pulled itself out of a mild recession with May's economy growing twice as quickly than expected, and services inflation remains high. This adds conviction that BoE will not lower interest rates at its next meeting on August 1.
7. **Comparison to Other Markets:** The UK's economic momentum contrasts with the US, where markets have increased bets on a September rate cut as the labor market weakens.
8. **Potential Challenges:** Some analysts point out that sterling remains 4% below its trade-weighted level before Brexit and further gains may be harder to come by if BoE joins other central banks in lowering interest rates later this year.
