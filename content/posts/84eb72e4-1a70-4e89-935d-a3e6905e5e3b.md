特斯拉交付量下降5%，但略超市场预期

特斯拉交付量下降5%，略超市场预期

- 特斯拉，全球最大的电动汽车（EV）制造商，报告了季度汽车交付量的第二连降。该公司4月至6月全球交付量为443,956辆，比去年同期下降4.7%，但略高于华尔街439,302辆的预期。
- 尽管面临需求放缓和来自中国竞争对手如比亚迪（报告第二季度交付量上升21%）等廉价竞争对手的激烈竞争，特斯拉的销售额从第一季度的令人失望的386,810辆反弹。这推动了8.5%的股价上涨。
- 该公司保留了作为全球最大电动汽车制造商的地位，并正在首席执行官埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）的领导下重新定位自己，专注于机器人技术和人工智能技术。计划于8月8日揭示完全自动驾驶“机器人出租车”。
- 特斯拉在过去一年面临挑战，包括股价在过去12个月下跌18%，市场资本化从2021年11月的峰值1.2万亿美元几乎减半。该公司还面临库存增长（两年多时间里增长超过136%）和消费者偏爱更便宜的混合动力车型，因为特斯拉不生产汽油或混合动力汽车。
- 尽管存在这些挑战，但能源存储业务在第二季度表现出潜力，部署了9,400兆瓦时，而第一季度为4,053兆瓦时。分析师认为该部门的价值高于特斯拉的汽车业务，因为其利润率更高，市场规模潜力巨大。

**关键要点：**
- 特斯拉交付的车辆较少，但仍然超出了预期，同时面临中国竞争对手比亚迪等带来的竞争。
- 该公司在埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）的领导下正在重新定位自己，专注于机器人技术和人工智能技术。
- 挑战包括股价下跌、库存增长以及消费者对更便宜的混合动力车型的偏好。
- 能源存储业务表现出潜力，第二季度的部署量高于第一季度。

 **Tesla Deliveries Fall 5%, Slightly Exceeding Market Expectations**

- Tesla, the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker, reported a second consecutive decline in quarterly vehicle deliveries. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles globally from April to June, down by 4.7% compared to the previous year but slightly above Wall Street expectations of 439,302 units.
- Despite facing slowing demand and stiff competition from cheaper Chinese rivals such as BYD (which reported a 21% rise in second-quarter deliveries), Tesla's sales rebounded from the first quarter's disappointing figures of 386,81n. This helped push up shares by 8.5%.
- The company retained its position as the world's largest EV maker and is repositioning itself under CEO Elon Musk to focus on robotics and AI technology. Plans for a fully autonomous "robotaxi" are set to be unveiled on August 8th.
- Tesla has faced challenges in the past year, including an 18% stock decline over the last 12 months and almost halving its market capitalization from its peak of $1.2tn in November 2021. The company is also dealing with growing inventories (up more than 136% over two years) and consumer preference for cheaper hybrid models, as Tesla does not produce petrol or hybrid vehicles.
- Despite these challenges, the energy storage business showed promise in Q2, deploying 9,400 megawatt hours compared to 4,053 in Q1. Analysts attribute more value to this division than Tesla's car business due to its higher profitability and tremendous potential market size.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Tesla delivered fewer vehicles but still exceeded expectations amidst competition from Chinese rivals like BYD.
- The company is repositioning itself under Elon Musk's leadership, focusing on robotics and AI technology.
- Challenges include declining stock value, growing inventories, and consumer preference for cheaper hybrid models.
- Energy storage business shows potential with increased deployment in Q2 compared to Q1.
