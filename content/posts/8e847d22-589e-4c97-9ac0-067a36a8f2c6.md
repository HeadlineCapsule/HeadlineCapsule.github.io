默多克家族信托控制权或将易主 家族成员分道扬镳

# 控制家庭信托的斗争

随着鲁珀特·默多克试图将权力移交给长子拉里，不可撤销的家庭信托的控制权即将发生法律斗争。这位93岁的媒体大亨希望修改持有家族在福克斯和新闻公司利益的信托，在鲁珀特去世后授予拉里对其投票权和决策权的充分控制权。

## 要点：

1. **鲁珀特·默多克的举动**：家长希望通过在去世后将投票权和决策权的充分控制权交给长子拉里来改造家庭信托。这是在鲁珀特去年辞去福克斯新闻、泰晤士报和澳大利亚报主席职位之后发生的。

2. **家庭信托**：最初，控制该实体的权力在鲁珀特去世时将分成默多克四个长子——拉里、詹姆斯、伊丽莎白和普伦西之间的控制权。然而，鲁珀特现在希望修改这一安排。

3. **法律斗争**：内华达州遗嘱专员裁定，法院听证会将确定信托修正案是否出于善意且仅造福默多克的孩子。预计9月将举行听证会。

4. **家庭紧张局势**：这一举动重新点燃了家族内部长期存在的紧张局势，尤其是詹姆斯和他的父亲和长子拉里之间的紧张关系。自2019年辞去福克斯首席执行官一职并离开新闻公司董事会以来，詹姆斯一直与福克斯新闻和新闻公司保持距离。

5. **政治分歧**：默多克的孩子们持有不同的政治观点，拉里、伊丽莎白和普伦西比詹姆斯更保守。对信托的拟议变化旨在为福克斯新闻和新闻公司新闻机构未来的保守方向奠定基础。

6. **投票权**：在鲁珀特去世后，他四个长子将在家庭信托中享有平等的投票权。然而，拉里的三个兄弟姐妹可以联合起来阻止他的决定。

7. **离婚起源**：目前的现状是继鲁珀特1999年与安娜·托尔夫离婚之后确定的，他们四个孩子在父亲去世后将享有平等的投票权。格蕾丝和克洛伊是默多克与温迪·邓格的孩子，拥有经济利益，但对信托没有投票控制权。

8. **家庭分歧**：虽然拉里的三个兄弟姐妹反对父亲的举动，但他们在更广泛的问题上并不一定一致，并共同由克拉维特、斯怀恩和摩尔公司的加里·博恩斯坦代表。

9. **猜测和缺席**：默多克观察者猜测家族内部存在裂痕，因为詹姆斯、伊丽莎白和普伦西没有参加鲁珀特7月的婚礼。该信托之前曾探索在福克斯出售其21世纪福克斯娱乐资产给迪士尼后购买詹姆斯的选择权。

 **Legal Battle Over Control of Family Trust**

The legal battle over the control of an irrevocable family trust is looming as Rupert Murdoch attempts to hand power to his eldest son, Lachlan. The 93-year-old media baron seeks to amend the trust that holds the family's interests in Fox and News Corp, granting full control of its voting powers and decision-making to Lachlan after Rupert's death.

**Key Points:**

1. **Rupert Murdoch's move:** The patriarch aims to overhaul the family trust by giving his eldest son, Lachlan, full control of its voting powers and decision-making posthumously. This comes after Rupert stepped down as chair of Fox News, The Times, and The Australian last year.
2. **Family Trust:** Control of the entity was initially meant to be split between Murdoch's four eldest children - Lachlan, James, Elisabeth, and Prudence - upon his death. However, Rupert now seeks to amend this arrangement.
3. **Legal Battle:** A Nevada probate commissioner has ruled that a court hearing will determine whether the trust amendments are in good faith and solely benefit Murdoch's children. The hearing is expected in September.
4. **Family Tensions:** This move reignites long-simmering tensions within the family, particularly between James and his father and elder brother Lachlan. James has distanced himself from Fox News and News Corp since stepping down as CEO of Fox in 2019 and leaving the News Corp board in 202
5. **Political Differences:** Murdoch's children have varying political views, with Lachlan, Elisabeth, and Prudence being more conservative than James. The proposed changes to the trust aim to cement a conservative direction for Fox News and News Corp news outlets in the future.
6. **Voting Rights:** After Rupert's death, each of his four eldest children will have an equal voting right within the family trust. However, Lachlan's three siblings could potentially block his decisions by combining their voting rights.
7. **Divorce Origins:** The current status quo was established following Rupert's 1999 divorce from Anna Torv, with each of their four children having an equal voting right after the patriarch's death. Grace and Chloe, Murdoch's children from his marriage to Wendi Deng, have economic interests but no voting control in the trust.
8. **Family Disagreement:** While Lachlan's three siblings oppose their father's move, they are not necessarily aligned on wider matters and are jointly represented by Gary Bornstein of Cravath, Swaine & Moore.
9. **Speculation and Absence:** Murdoch watchers speculated about a family rift after James, Elisabeth, and Prudence were absent from Rupert's recent wedding in July. The trust had previously explored options to buy out James following Fox's sale of its 21st Century Fox entertainment assets to Disney.

**Conclusion:** A legal battle is set to determine the future control of Murdoch's family trust, with Rupert attempting to grant full voting power and decision-making authority to his eldest son Lachlan after his death. The move has reignited tensions within the family and raised questions about political differences among the siblings.
