戴森将裁掉英国员工的四分之一

**戴森宣布裁员，全球重组**

吸尘器制造商戴森宣布计划在英国裁员约1000人。这一举措是更大范围的全球重组计划的一部分，旨在将其全球员工人数减少约四分之一。这次裁员来得令人意外，与英国大选或商业领袖关于经济优先事项的讨论等近期政治事件无关。

戴森在激烈竞争的全球市场中运营，在其最大的市场亚洲面临当地竞争对手的挑战。该公司首席执行官哈诺·基纳（Hanno Kirner）强调了保持敏捷和创新以保持竞争力的必要性。他还提到，裁员是一个艰难的决定，但对未来的准备是必要的。

英国目前的员工人数约为3500人，所有部门包括管理层都将受到影响。尽管这些变化，该公司打算在英国维持其研发中心，同时继续在新加坡进行产品开发工作。

戴森创始人詹姆斯·戴森（Sir James Dyson）此前曾表达了对英国政治领导层未优先考虑增长和创造财富的担忧。裁员可能会进一步复杂化人们对该公司的看法，尤其是在英国，因为该公司最近出于商业原因而不是脱欧相关的原因将总部迁至新加坡。

重组过程始于5月大选之前，并按国家逐一进行。戴森已扩展到吸尘器以外的产品，如吹风机、扇子、空气净化器和电动汽车研究（2019年放弃）。该公司继续为其无线产品开发电池技术。

总之，戴森裁员的决定是全球重组计划的一部分，旨在面对激烈的市场竞争和快速创新，保持竞争力。虽然这一举措可能会影响英国国内的看法，但该公司仍专注于确保未来的准备，以实现持续增长和成功。

 **Dyson Announces Job Cuts Amid Global Restructuring**

Vacuum cleaner manufacturer Dyson has announced plans to cut approximately 1,000 jobs in the UK. This move is part of a larger global restructuring effort aimed at reducing its workforce by about one-quarter worldwide. The job cuts come as a surprise and are unrelated to recent political events such as the UK general election or discussions with business leaders on economic priorities.

Dyson, which operates in fiercely competitive global markets, has faced challenges from local rivals in Asia where its largest market is located. The company's CEO Hanno Kirner emphasized the need for agility and innovation to remain competitive. He also mentioned that job cuts are a difficult decision but necessary for future preparedness.

The UK workforce, which currently stands at around 3,500 employees, will be affected across all departments including management layers. Despite these changes, the company intends to maintain its research and development center in Britain while continuing product development efforts in Singapore.

Dyson's founder Sir James Dyson has previously expressed concerns about the UK's political leadership not prioritizing growth and wealth generation. The job cuts may further complicate perceptions of the company within the UK, especially considering its recent move to establish headquarters in Singapore for commercial reasons rather than Brexit-related motivations.

The restructuring process began before May's general election and is being conducted on a country-by-country basis. Dyson has expanded beyond vacuum cleaners into other products such as hair dryers, fans, air purifiers, and electric vehicle research (which was abandoned in 2019). The company continues to work on battery technology for its cordless products.

In conclusion, Dyson's decision to cut jobs is part of a global restructuring effort aimed at maintaining competitiveness in the face of fierce market competition and rapid innovation. While this move may impact perceptions within the UK, it remains focused on ensuring future preparedness for continued growth and success.
