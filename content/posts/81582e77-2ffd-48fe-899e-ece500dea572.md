房产大亨 Jamie Ritblat 和 EY 与英国税务海关总署达成税务纠纷和解协议

房地产大亨 Jamie Ritblat 和会计师事务所 EY 与英国税务海关总署 (HMRC) 达成和解，解决了数十亿英镑的争议性收入和就业相关税款。

争端涉及来自 Ritblat 房地产投资公司 Delancey 的 1.41 亿英镑利润，这笔资金通过信托支付给了包括 Ritblat 本人在内的 24 名员工。HMRC 声称其对这些资金应征收收入和就业相关税款。

2015 年，各方达成协议，HMRC 接受来自 Ritblat 员工福利信托的 400 英镑，从而避免了进一步从受益人或 Delancey 公司征收税款。然而，HMRC 后来试图取消该交易，并追究 EY 在此和解中提供咨询建议的角色。

最近的和解协议结束了英国最引人关注和复杂的税务诉讼之一，涉及 Ritblat、EY 和 HMRC。参与的各方均未披露协议条款。

HMRC 表示，这一结果对英国纳税人来说是一个“好结果”，在不产生额外时间和诉讼成本的情况下获得了显著的和解金额。

 A property tycoon, **Jamie Ritblat**, and accountancy firm **EY** have reached a settlement with the UK's tax authority, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), over tens of millions of pounds in disputed income and employment-related taxes.

The dispute involved £141 million in profits from Ritblat'amo's real estate investment firm **Delancey** that were paid to 24 employees, including himself, through a trust. HMRC claimed it was owed income and employment-related taxes on these funds.

In 2015, the parties reached an agreement in which HMRC accepted £400 from Ritblat's employee benefit trust, preventing further collection of taxes from the beneficiaries or Delancey. However, HMRC later sought to invalidate this deal and pursue EY for its role in advising on the settlement.

The recent settlement brings an end to one of the UK's most high-profile and complex tax litigations involving Ritblat, EY, and HMRC. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed by any party involved.

HMRC stated that this outcome is a "good result for the UK taxpayer," securing a significant settlement sum without incurring further time and costs associated with litigation.
