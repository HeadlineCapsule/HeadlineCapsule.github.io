性别平等基金表现令人失望

# 性别平等基金表现不佳

**摘要**：性别平等基金在不同时间段内表现不佳，其相关 Morningstar 指数表现更好。今年，只有约 20% 的基金表现优于基准，同时基金发行数量下降，清算数量增加。由于自愿报告、历史数据不确定性和影响收益的行业/地域限制，建议投资者考虑这些基金使用的可持续性因素数据。

**要点**：
- 性别平等基金在不同时间段（3 年内 10%，今年 20%）的表现与 Morningstar 基准相比表现不佳。
- 清算的基金数量超过发行数量，表明对性别平等投资的兴趣下降。
- 投资者应仔细审查这些基金使用的数据，并考虑自愿报告、历史数据质量以及影响收益的行业/地域限制等因素。
- 性别平等基金关注的主题包括女性领导角色、平等薪酬机会、有利于女性的政策和透明度（例如联合国妇女赋权原则）。然而，这些因素并不一定能带来优异表现。
- 一些性别平等 ETF 表现良好，因为它们与其他表现良好的指数具有类似的敞口，而不是因为它们对性别指标的关注。
- 某些性别平等基金的高费用可能会影响与低成本指数基金相比的表现。

**投资者考虑因素**：

1. 评估性别平等基金使用的数据和方法，包括自愿报告和历史数据质量。
2. 了解行业/地域限制可能对这些基金的投资回报产生重大影响。
3. 评估仅关注性别指标是否能带来优异表现，或者其他因素（例如市场领导力）是否发挥更重要的作用。
4. 将性别平等基金的表现与低成本指数基金进行比较，并考虑将多余费用捐给女性慈善机构，以实现潜在的积极影响。

 **Summary**: Gender equality funds have underperformed their relevant Morningstar indices over various time periods. Only about 20% of these funds outperformed their benchmark year-to-date, with a declining trend in launches and an increase in closures. Investors are advised to consider the data used by these funds for sustainability factors due to voluntary reporting, historical data uncertainty, and sector/geographical constraints impacting returns.

**Key Points**:
- Gender equality funds have struggled with performance compared to their Morningstar benchmarks over different time periods (10% over 3 years, 20% year-to-date).
- Fund closures are outnumbering launches, indicating a declining interest in gender equality investments.
- Investors should scrutinize the data used by these funds and consider factors such as voluntary reporting, historical data quality, and sector/geographical constraints affecting returns.
- Gender equality funds focus on themes like women's leadership roles, equal pay opportunities, female-friendly policies, and transparency (e.g., UN Women’s Empowerment Principles). However, these factors may not necessarily lead to outperformance.
- Some gender equality ETFs have performed well due to similar exposure as other indices that also performed well rather than their focus on gender metrics.
- High fees in some gender equality funds can impact returns compared to low-cost index funds.

**Considerations for Investors**:
1. Assess the data and methodology used by gender equality funds, including voluntary reporting and historical data quality.
2. Understand that sector/geographical constraints may heavily influence investment returns in these funds.
3. Evaluate whether a focus on gender metrics alone can drive outperformance or if other factors (e.g., market leadership) play a more significant role.
4. Compare the performance of gender equality funds to low-cost index funds and consider allocating excess fees towards women's charities for potential positive impact.
