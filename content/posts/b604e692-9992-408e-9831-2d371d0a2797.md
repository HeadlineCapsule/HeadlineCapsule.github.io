Coinbase因“高风险”客户被英国监管机构罚款350万英镑

英国监管机构因Coinbase处理高风险客户的支付业务而罚款350万英镑

英国金融行为监管局（FCA）对加密货币交易所Coinbase的子公司CB Payments Ltd处以总计350万英镑的罚款，因为该公司为超过13000名“高风险”客户提供了支付服务。这是FCA首次针对一家促进加密货币交易的公司采取执法行动。

这些高风险客户包括被制裁人员、政治暴露人员（PEPs）以及自称失业的人员。由于CB Payments Ltd一再违反防止该公司向此类高风险客户提供服务的规定，因此受到处罚。

CB Payments Ltd于2020年10月与FCA达成了“自愿要求”协议，此前对该公司金融犯罪控制框架有效性的担忧。该协议旨在限制CB Payments Ltd接受高风险客户。然而，该公司未能遵守这一要求，并在接下来的三年里继续为这些有争议的客户提供服务。

FCA表示，大约31%的高风险客户通过CB Payments Ltd存入了总计约2490万美元，然后用于提现和通过其他Coinbase实体进行的加密货币交易，交易总额约为2.26亿美元。

Coinbase承认了FCA的调查结果，并表达了其对提高合规性的承诺。该公司强调，在所涉三年内，高风险个人仅占CB Payments Ltd登录的所有客户的0.34%。

该处罚突显了金融机构必须认真对待与加密货币相关的洗钱风险，并实施强有力的控制措施以防止犯罪活动。

 **UK Regulator Fines Coinbase £3.5 Million for Handling Payments for High-Risk Customers**

The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined crypto exchange Coinbase's subsidiary, CB Payments Ltd, a total of **£3.5 million** for providing payment services to over 13,000 "high-risk" customers. This marks the first enforcement action by the FCA against a company enabling cryptocurrency trading.

The high-risk customers included individuals on sanctions lists, politically exposed persons (PEPs), and those who declared themselves unemployed. The fine was imposed due to CB Payments Ltd's repeated breaches of requirements preventing the firm from offering services to such risky clients.

CB Payments Ltd entered into a "voluntary requirement" with the FCA in October n, 2020, following concerns about its financial crime control framework's effectiveness. This agreement was meant to restrict CB Payments Ltd from taking on high-risk customers. However, the company failed to adhere to this requirement and continued providing services to these contentious clients for three years afterward.

The FCA stated that approximately 31% of the high-risk customers deposited a total of about $24.9 million through CB Payments Ltd, which was then used for withdrawals and crypto trades via other Coinbase entities, amounting to roughly $226 million in transactions.

Coinbase acknowledged the FCA's findings and expressed its commitment to improving regulatory compliance. The company emphasized that high-risk individuals accounted for only 0.34% of all customers onboarded by CB Payments Ltd during the three-year period in question.

This penalty highlights the importance of financial institutions taking money laundering risks associated with cryptocurrencies seriously and implementing robust controls to prevent criminal activities.
