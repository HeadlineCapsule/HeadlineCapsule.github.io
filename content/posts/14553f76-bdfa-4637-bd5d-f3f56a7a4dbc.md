谷歌母公司与Wiz结束230亿美元收购谈判

**谷歌母公司字母表** 已结束有关以 230 亿美元收购以色列网络安全公司 **Wiz** 的谈判，终止了本将成为谷歌历史上最大型交易的收购。讨论旨在收购 Wiz，该公司上次估值为 120 亿美元，并获得塞奎奥资本和 Thrive Capital 等主要风险投资公司的支持。

Wiz 由以色列精英网络情报部队的校友创立，在特拉维夫和美国设有办事处，已决定继续其首次公开募股（IPO）的道路，而不是被字母表收购。该决定通过周一发送给员工的电子邮件传达。

字母表和 Wiz 董事会的一些成员对交易是否能通过监管审查持怀疑态度，最终导致反对该交易的派系导致其终止。这发生在监管机构近年来对科技巨头交易采取更严格态度的背景下。

失败的收购案例遵循了其他高调案例的后续行动，其中科技巨头在获得必要监管批准方面面临挑战，例如 Adobe 放弃以 200 亿美元收购产品设计软件公司 Figma 的计划以及微软与人工智能初创公司 OpenAI 的合作关系受到监管机构审查。

 **Google parent company Alphabet** has ended talks on a proposed $23 billion acquisition of Israeli cybersecurity firm **Wiz**, terminating what would have been the largest deal in Google's history. The discussions were aimed at acquiring Wiz, which was last valued at $12 billion and backed by major venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital.

Wiz, founded by alumni of Israel's elite cyber intelligence unit with offices in Tel Aviv and the US, has decided to continue on its path towards an initial public offering (IPO) instead of being acquired by Alphabet. The decision was communicated through an email sent to employees on Monday.

Some members of both Alphabet and Wiz's boards were skeptical about whether the deal would pass regulatory scrutiny, with factions lobbying against it ultimately leading to its termination. This comes amidst a growing trend of antitrust regulators taking a harder stance on Big Tech deals in recent years.

The failed acquisition follows other high-profile cases where tech giants faced challenges obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, such as Adobe's abandoned plans to acquire product design software company Figma for $20 billion and Microsoft's partnership with AI start-up OpenAI being examined by regulators.
