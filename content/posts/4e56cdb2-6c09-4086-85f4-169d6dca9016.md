法航-荷航警告巴黎奥运会将影响财务业绩

# 简要新闻摘要：

**文章摘要：**

法国航空公司-荷兰皇家航空公司警告称，由于大量潜在游客避免在奥运会期间预订前往巴黎的旅行，预计将受到财务影响。该航空公司集团表示，在奥运会即将于7月26日至8月11日举行之际，进出法国首都的客流量落后于其他主要欧洲城市。

**要点：**
- **法国航空公司-荷兰皇家航空公司** 预计6月至8月期间将因国际市场避开巴黎而受到收入影响。
- 法国游客正在推迟他们的假期或做出替代计划，导致夏季酒店预订减少。
-该公司预计收入损失为**1.6亿欧元至18亿欧元**，伯恩斯坦的分析师建议今年整体税前利润预测减少13%。
- 尽管有警告，但旅游官员预计奥运会期间将有大约1500万名游客；然而，由于担心交通中断，巴黎一半的居民计划暂时离开。
- Airbnb的房源数量增加，导致奥运会期间住宿选择供大于求，价格下降。
- **法国航空公司-荷兰皇家航空公司**及其主要欧洲竞争对手德国汉莎航空类似的收入预期引发了人们对市场基础疲软以及奥运会和罢工行动影响的担忧。

 **Article Summary:** 

Air France-KLM has warned of an expected financial hit due to a significant number of potential visitors avoiding bookings for trips to Paris during the Olympic Games. The airline group stated that traffic to and from the French capital is lagging behind other major European cities in anticipation of the games, which will take place between July 26 and August 11.

**Key Points:**
- **Air France-KLM** expects a negative impact on revenues between June and August due to avoidance of Paris by international markets during the Olympic Games.
- French visitors are postponing their holidays or making alternative plans, contributing to reduced hotel bookings over the summer.
- The company anticipates a revenue loss of **€160mn to €18n** and analysts at Bernstein suggest an overall 13% reduction in consensus pre-tax profit forecast for this year.
- Despite warnings, tourism officials expect around 15 million visitors during the games; however, half of Paris' residents plan to leave temporarily due to transport disruption concerns.
- Airbnb listings have increased, leading to an oversupply and decreased prices in accommodation options for the Olympic Games period.
- Similar revenue expectations at **Air France-KLM** and its main European rival Lufthansa raise questions about underlying market softness alongside the Olympics and strike action impacts.
