南非的尤利乌斯·马勒马面临新的腐败指控

**摘要：**
南非经济自由战士（EFF）领导人朱利叶斯·马勒马面临新的腐败指控，这些指控来自已倒闭的VBS互助银行前负责人Tshifhiwa Matodzi的宣誓书。这些指控涉及贿赂和通过前公司转移资金以谋取个人利益。

**要点：**
- 马勒马被指控从该银行盗取了20亿兰特（1.1亿美元）中受益，这些指控可追溯到6年前。
- Matodzi的263页宣誓书详细介绍了VBS如何向政府官员行贿，并牵涉到会计师事务所KPMG。
- 2017年4月，马勒马在一家公寓与Matodzi会面，据称他提出向EFF提供捐款，以换取对VBS互助银行的负面言论保持沉默。
- 鉴于南非政治脆弱且最近成立由非洲人国民大会党（ANC）和民主党（DA）组成的联合政府，这些新证据可能产生重大政治影响。
- 马勒马驳斥了这些指控，称它们并非新指控，可从EFF档案中找到。

**扩展信息的潜在领域：**
1. 这些腐败指控对南非的政治格局和政治稳定的影响。
2. 马勒马之前面临类似指控的情况，以及他的政党EFF是如何处理的。
3. 其他政党，如ActionSA和DA对针对马勒马和Shivambu的新证据的反应。

 **Summary:**  
South Africa's Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), faces new corruption allegations based on an affidavit from Tshifhiwa Matodzi, former head of collapsed VBS Mutual Bank. The accusations involve bribes and misuse of funds that were diverted through front companies for personal gain.

**Key Points:**  
- Malema is accused of benefiting from R2bn ($110mn) stolen from the bank, with allegations dating back six years.
- Matodzi's 263-page affidavit details how VBS paid bribes to government officials and implicates auditors KPMG in the scandal.
- Malema met with Matodzi at a penthouse in April 2017, where he allegedly offered donations to the EFF as gratification for silence on damaging remarks about VBS Mutual Bank.
- The latest evidence could have significant political implications given South Africa's fragile politics and recent coalition government formation between ANC and DA parties.
- Malema has dismissed these allegations, stating that they are not new and can be found in the EFF archives.

**Potential Areas for Expanded Information:**  
1. The impact of these corruption allegations on South Africa's political landscape and stability.
2. Previous instances of Malema facing similar accusations and how they were handled by his party, the EFF.
3. Reactions from other political parties such as ActionSA and DA to the new evidence against Malema and Shivambu.
