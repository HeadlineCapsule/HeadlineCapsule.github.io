欧央行高管敲响警钟 警告影子银行业风险上升

# 欧央行官员：非银行金融中介机构的快速增长对欧元区金融体系稳定构成重大威胁

**新闻摘要：**
欧洲中央银行（ECB）高级官员伊丽莎白·麦考尔（Elizabeth McCaul）强调，非银行金融中介机构（NBFI）的迅速发展对欧元区金融体系的稳定性构成了显著威胁。这些监管较少的实体通常被称为“影子银行”，其资产在2021年第三季度达到42.9万亿欧元，超过传统贷款机构近5万亿欧元。

**要点：**
- 自全球金融危机以来，NBFI 部门的增长令人瞩目，也让欧央行官员感到担忧，因为该部门缺乏可见性，且信贷动态变化迅速。
- 影子银行、传统贷款机构之间的联系以及系统性风险的不透明是主要担忧因素。
- 伊丽莎白·麦考尔（Elizabeth McCaull）援引了 Archegos Capital Management 倒闭和英国债务市场抛售等过去的事件作为这些风险突然显现的警告信号。
- 欧央行监督委员会成员强调，一些私募股权和信贷基金正在变得过于庞大，无法像银行那样发挥缓冲作用。
- 麦考尔驳斥了私募股权高管关于通过投资者多样化降低风险的说法，并将其与 2008 年次贷危机进行了比较。
- 金融稳定委员会监控非银行金融中介机构及其对价值 218 万亿美元的全球金融资产的影响。

**担忧：**
- NBFI 部门缺乏透明度，不在银行监管和监督范围内。
- 由于影子银行和传统贷款机构之间通过回购协议、信用额度或衍生品保持不透明的联系，可能会产生系统性风险。
- 大型私募股权和信贷基金可能无法在金融市场中发挥缓冲作用。

**行动：**
- 欧央行正在检查欧元区银行是否全面了解其对 NBFIs 的敞口。
- 世界顶级金融监管机构正在努力在传统银行业之外的监管较少领域增加透明度并降低风险，但对直接监督非银行机构犹豫不决。

 **Article Summary:**  
A senior European Central Bank official, Elizabeth McCaul, highlighted the rapid growth of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFI) as a significant threat to the stability of the Eurozone's financial system. These lightly regulated entities are often referred to as "shadow banks" and have assets worth €42.9tn in Q3 2021, surpassing traditional lenders by nearly €5tn.

**Key Points:**  
- The NBFI sector's growth since the global financial crisis has been remarkable and concerning to ECB officials due to its lack of visibility and potential for rapid credit dynamics changes.
- Opacity in links between shadow banks, traditional lenders, and systemic risks is a major concern.
- Elizabeth McCaull cited past incidents like Archegos Capital Management's collapse and the UK debt market sell-off as warning signs of these risks materializing suddenly.
- The ECB supervisory board member emphasized that some private equity and credit funds are becoming too large to act as shock absorbers, similar to banks.
- McCaul dismissed claims by private equity executives about reducing risk through diversification among investors, drawing parallels with the subprime mortgage crisis of 2e08.
- The Financial Stability Board monitors non-bank financial intermediaries and their impact on global financial assets worth $218tn.

**Concerns:**  
- Lack of transparency in the NBFI sector, which is outside banking supervisory and regulatory perimeters.
- Potential systemic risks due to opaque links between shadow banks and traditional lenders via repurchase agreements, lines of credit, or derivatives.
- The rise of large private equity and credit funds that may not act as shock absorbers in the financial market.

**Actions:**  
- ECB is checking if Eurozone banks have a full view of their exposure to NBFIs.
- World's top financial watchdogs are working on ways to bring more transparency and reduce risks in lightly regulated areas outside the traditional banking sector, but hesitant to directly supervise non-banks.
