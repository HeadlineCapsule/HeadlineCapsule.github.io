特斯拉汽车首次登上当地中国政府采购名单

# 特斯拉进入中国政府采购名单

这篇文章讨论了电动汽车制造商特斯拉（Tesla）首次被列入中国地方政府采购名单的情况。在特斯拉面临世界最大汽车市场中国日益激烈的竞争之际，这一举动意义重大。江苏省负责这一纳入工作，在批准公共、党派和政府团体购买的10个品牌中，特斯拉脱颖而出。

在中国，电动汽车销售占全球总销量60%，因此中国市场对特斯拉至关重要，也是其在美国以外的一个关键市场。尽管中国当地品牌竞争激烈，但特斯拉的 Model Y SUV 被添加到采购名单中，表明其在中国市场仍然表现强劲。然而，今年5月，特斯拉在中国的市场份额略有下降，从6.9% 降至6.4%。尽管如此，杰富瑞（Jefferies）的分析师指出，中国仍然是特斯拉的重要市场，其20%的销售量和50%的产量都来自中国。

文章还提到了中国与西方之间的贸易紧张局势，欧盟对中国电动汽车进口征收临时关税，因为在为中国汽车制造商提供补贴的问题上存在未解决的问题。尽管面临这些挑战，特斯拉在今年早些时候满足了中国汽车工业协会制定的数据安全要求后，获得了北京的认可。

在伊隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）今年4月访问北京并与中国科技巨头百度达成协议之后，特斯拉已采取措施在中国整合其部分自动驾驶技术。目前，上海市政府正在测试10辆配备该软件的特斯拉汽车。

总之，特斯拉被列入中国政府采购名单，标志着该公司在应对中国日益激烈的竞争和贸易紧张局势方面迈出了重要的一步。

 **Tesla's Entry into Chinese Government Purchase List**  

The article discusses how electric vehicles (EV) manufacturer Tesla has been included for the first time on a local government procurement list in China. This move comes as Elon Musk’s company faces increasing competition within the world's largest car market, **China**. The Chinese province of Jiangsu is responsible for this inclusion, which lists 10 brands approved for purchase by public, party and government groups.

Tesla stands out on the list as it remains the only foreign-owned EV manufacturer among its competitors such as Geely's Volvo Cars, SAIC's MG, and state-owned Changan. This inclusion is significant for Tesla since **China** accounts for 60% of global EV sales, making it a crucial market outside the United States.

The article also highlights that despite rising competition from local brands in China, Tesla's presence remains strong with its Model Y SUV being added to the procurement list. In May, however, Tesla experienced a slight decline in market share within **China**, dropping from 6.9% to 
6.4%. Nonetheless, analysts at Jefferies note that China remains an essential market for Tesla with 20% of its sales volume and 50% of production occurring in the country.

The article also touches upon trade tensions between **China** and the West, mentioning provisional tariffs on Chinese EV imports by the EU due to unresolved issues regarding subsidies for Chinese carmakers. Despite these challenges, Tesla has managed to gain endorsement from Beijing earlier this year after meeting data security requirements set by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

Following Elon Musk's visit to **Beijing** in April and a subsequent deal with Chinese tech giant Baidu, Tesla has made strides towards integrating its partially autonomous driving technology within the country. The government of Shanghai is currently testing 10 Tesla cars equipped with this software on select city streets.

In conclusion, Tesla's inclusion in a Chinese local government procurement list marks an important milestone for the company as it navigates through increasing competition and trade tensions within **China**.
