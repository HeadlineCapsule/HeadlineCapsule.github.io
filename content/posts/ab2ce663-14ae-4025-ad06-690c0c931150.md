由高盛交易员创立的精品银行寻求英国扩张

**精品银行扩张** 

一家由前高盛交易员创立的精品投资银行 Ardea Partners 正计划在英国扩大业务，并任命了两名高级管理人员。该银行成立于 2017 年，目前在纽约拥有约 80 名员工。最近，它招募了伊恩·切希尔爵士作为伦敦办事处的高级顾问，该办事处现在有大约 30 名员工。

**关键任命：** 

- **伊恩·切希尔爵士** - 加入 Ardea Partners 担任高级顾问，并将与伦敦办事处的其他经验丰富专业人士一起工作。他的从业背景包括 Channel n4、房地产公司 Land Securities、Debenhams 和 Kingfisher 的董事长职务。
- **西蒙·莱昂斯** - Ardea Partners 欧洲区联合负责人；此前曾在 PJT Partners 和瑞银银行公司任职。

扩大在英国业务的举措，因为精品银行正在越来越多地从公共和私营部门招聘高级人士，例如拉扎德 (Lazard) 的斯蒂芬·洛维格罗夫爵士。精品运营在英国金融市场上越来越突出，其中一些银行在今年上半年获得了近 40% 的收购咨询费。

Ardea Partners 在各个行业都提供了咨询服务，并继续扩大其在欧洲的存在。该银行拒绝对他们的扩张计划发表评论。

 **Boutique Bank Expansion**  

A boutique investment bank founded by former Goldman Sachs dealmakers, Ardea Partners, is aiming for expansion in the UK with two senior appointments. The bank was established in 2017 and currently has about 80 employees based in New York. Recently, it recruited Sir Ian Cheshire as a senior adviser to its London office, which now includes approximately 30 staff members.

**Key Appointments:**  
- **Sir Ian Cheshire** - Joined Ardea Partners as a senior adviser and will work alongside other experienced professionals in the London office. His background includes roles such as chair of Channel n4, property group Land Securities, Debenhams, and Kingfisher.
- **Simon Lyons** - Co-head of Europe for Ardea Partners; previously worked at PJT Partners and UBS banking firms.

The move to expand in the UK comes as boutique banks are increasingly hiring senior figures from public and private sectors, such as Sir Stephen Lovegrove at Lazard. Boutique operations have gained prominence in the UK financial market, with some achieving almost 40% of takeover advisory fees in the first half of this year.

Ardea Partners has advised on various deals across sectors and continues to grow its presence in Europe. The bank declined to comment on their expansion plans.
