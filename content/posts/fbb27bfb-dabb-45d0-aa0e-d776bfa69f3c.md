奥巴马和佩洛西加剧对拜登的质疑，要求他退出竞选

# 随着人们越来越担心他的胜选可能性，乔·拜登面临着民主党老年人的巨大压力，要求他放弃连任。蒙大拿州的乔恩·特斯特成为第二位敦促拜登不要寻求连任的民主党参议员，而加利福尼亚州众议员吉姆·科斯塔也呼吁他让位并把火炬传递给下一代。 20多名国会议员公开表达了对拜登在即将到来的选举中胜选机会的担忧。

## 关键要点：
- 乔·拜登面临着自己政党内部越来越大的压力，老年民主党人敦促他不要寻求连任，因为人们怀疑他在对抗唐纳德·特朗普时能否获胜，以及这会对国会选举产生什么影响。
- 蒙大拿州的参议员乔恩·特斯特是第二位公开呼吁拜登退出竞选的民主党参议员，他引用了人们对总统表现和决策的担忧。
- 前总统巴拉克·奥巴马据报道对拜登获胜的道路表示怀疑，而前众议院议长南希·佩洛西也被认为是对他的胜选机会持悲观态度。
- 尽管有这些让他让位的呼吁，但拜登竞选活动维护他将留在民主党票上并继续竞选。
- 拜登在全国和摇摆州的民意调查中表现不佳，美联社的一项民意调查显示，近三分之二的民主党选民希望他让位。预测市场PredictIt也反映了拜登作为民主党提名人的胜率下降，而副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯的胜率上升。

## 背景知识：
- 这一情况自上个月以来一直在发展，在拜登与特朗普的辩论后，人们对他的未来进行了激烈的猜测。一位众议院民主党议员称，这一危机已经到了“临界点”。
- 一些有影响力的捐赠者和操作人员相信拜登很快就会辞职，而其他人则指出，那些呼吁他退出竞选的人越来越多。

 **Summary**: Amid growing concerns over his electability, Joe Biden faces mounting pressure from senior Democrats to drop his re-election bid. Montana's Jon Tester becomes the second Democratic senator to urge Biden not to seek another term, while Jim Costa, a California House member, also calls for him to step aside and pass the torch to the next generation. More than 20 members of Congress have openly expressed concerns about Biden's chances in the upcoming election.

**Key Points**:
- **Joe Biden** is facing increasing pressure from within his own party, with senior Democrats urging him not to seek re-election due to doubts over his electability against Donald Trump and potential impact on congressional races.
- **Senator Jon Tester** of Montana becomes the second Democratic senator to publicly call for Biden to drop out of the race, citing concerns about the president's performance and decision-making.
- Former President Barack Obama has reportedly expressed doubts about Biden's path to victory, while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is said to be pessimistic about his chances as well.
- Despite these calls for him to step aside, the **Biden campaign** maintains that he will remain on the Democratic ticket and continue in the race.
- Biden's standing in national and swing state polls has been less than favorable, with an Associated Press poll showing nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters wanting him to step aside. The online prediction market PredictIt also reflects a decrease in chances for Biden as the Democratic nominee and an increase for Vice President Kamala Harris.

**Contextual Notes**:
- This situation has been developing since last month, with speculation over Biden's future intensifying after his performance at a debate with Trump. The crisis reached a "breaking point" according to one House Democratic lawmaker.
- Some influential donors and operatives believe that Biden may step down soon, while others have noted increased momentum among those calling for him to leave the race.
