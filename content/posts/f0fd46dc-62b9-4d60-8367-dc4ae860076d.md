中国电动汽车激光制造商反击五角大楼黑名单

# 中国电动汽车激光制造商赫赛（Hesai）反击五角大楼黑名单

赫赛（Hesai），全球最大的电动汽车（EV）激光雷达传感器生产商，一家总部位于上海、在纽约设有业务的公司，已对美国政府采取法律行动，此前该公司被列入一份涉嫌支持中国军队的中国实体名单。五角大楼的黑名单导致了投资者的担忧，并导致赫赛股价大幅下跌。

当他从美国国会研究服务（CRS）了解到这些指控时，赫赛首席执行官大卫·李（David Li）感到“震惊”，该服务声称他的公司通过激光雷达技术支持中国军队。五角大楼的黑名单加剧了这些担忧，导致赫赛的市值下跌。

作为回应，李决定对美国政府采取法律行动，认为没有证据表明他的公司支持中国军队或参与任何军民融合（MCF）活动。他还强调，赫赛与中国的军事组织没有任何联系，并保持严格的数据安全措施。

赫赛一直受到美国专家的审查，包括指控该公司在上海的专用 MCF 区域内拥有设施，并使用其技术对新疆的维吾尔穆斯林进行压制。然而，赫赛反驳了这些说法，称它没有在这些区域内或附近拥有任何设施，并且不了解其产品被用于所指控的情况。

美国政府的担忧不仅限于激光雷达技术，还包括中国法律要求国内公司向政府移交数据的潜在风险。白宫已经启动了一项调查，以确定使用包括激光雷达在内的传感器的中国汽车是否对美国国家安全构成风险。

赫赛 CEO 李承认，华盛顿和北京之间的地缘政治紧张局势为该公司在海外销售带来了不确定性，但对赫赛作为全球领先的激光雷达生产商的地位充满信心。预计全球激光雷达市场将蓬勃发展，到明年，中国预计将占据其中的三分之二。

总之，赫赛因被列入黑名单而受到美国政府的指控，称其通过电动汽车激光技术支持中国军队。该公司反驳了这些说法，强调没有证据将其与任何军事活动或上海的 MCF 区域联系起来。

 **Chinese EV laser maker, Hesai, fights back against Pentagon blacklisting**

Hesai, the world's largest producer of electric vehicle (EV) lidar sensors and a Shanghai-based company with operations in New York, has taken legal action against the US government after being added to a list of Chinese entities allegedly supporting China's military. The Pentagon blacklisting led to investment concerns and a significant drop in Hesai's share price.

Hesai CEO David Li was "shocked" when he learned about the accusations from the US Congressional Research Service (CRS) last May, which claimed that his company supported China's military through its lidar technology. The blacklisting by the Pentagon further exacerbated these concerns and led to a decline in Hesai's market value.

In response, Li has decided to take legal action against the US government, arguing that there is no evidence of his company supporting China's military or engaging in any activities related to military-civil fusion (MCF). He also emphasized that Hesai does not have connections with Chinese military organizations and maintains strict data security measures.

Hesai has faced scrutiny from US experts, including allegations of having facilities within dedicated MCF zones in Shanghai and using its technology for repressive purposes against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. However, Hesai disputed these claims, stating that it does not have any facility inside or adjacent to such zones nor is aware of its products being used as part of the allegations.

The US government's concerns extend beyond lidar technology and include potential risks associated with Chinese laws requiring domestic firms to hand over data to the government. The White House has launched an investigation into whether Chinese cars using sensors, including lidar, pose a risk to American national security.

Hesai CEO Li acknowledges that geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing create uncertainty for his company's overseas sales but remains confident in Hesai's position as the leading lidar producer globally. The global lidar market is forecasted to surge, with China expected to dominate about two-thirds of it by next year.

In conclusion, Hesai has taken legal action against the US government after being blacklisted due to allegations of supporting China's military through its EV laser technology. The company disputes these claims and emphasizes that there is no evidence linking them to any military activities or MCF zones in Shanghai.
