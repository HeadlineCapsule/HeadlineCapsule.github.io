前中情局分析师被控充当韩国特工

**前中情局分析师苏米·特里被指控充当韩国代理人**

美国前中情局分析师和著名的美国外交事务评论员苏米·特里（Sue Mi Terry）被美国检察官指控涉嫌充当韩国代理人。指控包括接受奢侈礼品，如设计师服装，并在米其林星级餐厅用餐，以换取向韩国情报官员披露敏感信息。

**要点：**

1. **对苏米·特里的指控**：她被指控从与美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯（Antony Blinken）的离记录谈中传递手写便条，并接受奢侈礼品，包括杜嘉班纳（Dolce & Gabbana）大衣、路易威登（Louis Vuitton）手袋和博柏利（Bottega Veneta）手袋。
2. **涉嫌秘密资金**：特里据称收到了一笔37万美元的资金，用于她控制的韩国事务公共政策项目。
3. **未能注册为外国代理人**：她被指控在未披露与韩国的关系之前，未能在国会作证时注册为外国代理人。
4. **职业背景**：特里曾在中情局、国家安全委员会、国家情报委员会、威尔逊中心和战略与国际研究中心工作。她在2011年离开政府部门，但据称两年后开始与她的处理人员沟通。
5. **法律代表回应**：特里的律师李沃洛斯基（Lee Wolosky）声称这些指控是毫无根据的，并在起诉建议她代表韩国行事时批评过韩国政府。
6. **相关组织**：外交关系委员会将特里置于无薪行政休假，并表示将配合任何调查；战略与国际研究中心拒绝置评。
7. **美国间谍活动的前述指控**：去年，泄露的情报文件表明，美国间谍监听了韩国官员讨论可能运往乌克兰的弹药运输。这在乔·拜登总统和韩国总统尹锡悦于2023年4月举行峰会时引起了担忧。

对特里的案件在曼哈顿联邦法院提起，突显了指控的严重性以及对美韩关系的潜在影响。

 **Former CIA Analyst Sue Mi Terry Charged with Acting as South Korean Agent**

A former CIA analyst and prominent foreign affairs commentator in the US, Sue Mi Terry, has been charged by US prosecutors for allegedly acting as a foreign agent for South Korea. The charges include accepting luxury gifts such as designer clothing and dining at Michelin-starred restaurants in exchange for disclosing sensitive information to South Korean intelligence officers.

**Key Points:**

1. **Accusations against Sue Mi Terry**: She is accused of passing handwritten notes from an off-record meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and accepting luxury gifts, including a Dolce & Gabbana coat, Louis Vuitton handbag, and Bottega Veneta handbag.
2. **Alleged Covert Funding**: Terry allegedly received $37,00amo funding for a public policy program on Korean affairs that she controlled.
3. **Failure to Register as Foreign Agent**: She is charged with failing to register as a foreign agent and not disclosing her ties to South Korea before testifying in front of Congress.
4. **Professional Background**: Terry has worked for the CIA, National Security Council, National Intelligence Council, Wilson Center, and Center for Strategic and International Studies. She left government service in 2011 but allegedly began communicating with her handler two years later.
5. **Response from Legal Representative**: Lee Wolosky, Terry's lawyer, claims the allegations are unfounded and that she has been a critic of the South Korean government during times when this indictment suggests she was acting on its behalf.
6. **Organizations Involved**: The Council for Foreign Relations placed Terry on unpaid administrative leave and stated they would cooperate with any investigation, while CSIS declined to comment.
7. **Previous Allegations of US Spying**: Last year, leaked intelligence documents suggested the US had spied on South Korean officials discussing ammunition shipments potentially for Ukraine. This raised concerns during a summit between President Joe Biden and South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol in April 2e3.

The case against Terry was filed in Manhattan federal court, highlighting the seriousness of the allegations and potential implications on US-South Korean relations.
