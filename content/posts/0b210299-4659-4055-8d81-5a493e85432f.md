“AI教母”李飞飞四个月内打造10亿美元初创企业

李飞飞，斯坦福大学著名的计算机科学家和“人工智能教母”，在短短四个月内成功创立了一家价值上亿美元的初创公司 World Labs。该公司专注于在人工智能（AI）系统中开发“空间智能”，以增强其处理视觉数据、理解三维空间和与真实世界环境交互的能力。

要点：

1. 李飞飞在斯坦福大学部分休假期间创立了 World Labs，这受到 2022 年 11 月 OpenAI 发布 ChatGPT 聊天机器人所引发的投资者对生成式 AI 技术兴趣激增的启发。

3. 这家初创公司已经从顶级科技投资者那里获得了两轮资金，例如 Andreessen Horowitz 和 Radical Ventures，业务价值超过 10 亿美元。World Labs 在最近的融资轮中获得了约 1 亿美元。

4. 李飞飞对空间智能的愿景是训练出能够理解三维空间中复杂物理世界动态和物体之间相互关系的 AI 系统，这可能会革命性地改变自主系统和计算机视觉技术。

5. World Labs 与其他 AI 初创公司（例如 Skild）一样，吸引了投资者的兴趣，因为它们开发了能够了解和操纵周围环境的智能机器人。

总之，李飞飞的新企业 World Labs 在科技行业迅速获得了重大进展，从顶级投资者那里获得了大量资金来开发 AI 系统的空间智能。这项创新可能会导致自主系统和计算机视觉技术的主要进步，使机器能够更好地理解和与真实世界环境交互。

 **Fei-Fei Li**, a renowned computer scientist at Stanford University and the "godmother of AI", has successfully established a billion-dollar start-up called **World Labs** in just four months. The company focuses on developing 'spatial intelligence' within artificial intelligence (AI) systems to enhance their ability to process visual data, understand three-dimensional spaces and interact with real-world environments.

Key points:
1. Fei-Fei Li founded World Labs while on partial leave from Stanford University in April 2cued by the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022, which sparked a surge of investor interest in generative AI technologies.
3. The start-up has already raised two rounds of funding from top tech investors such as **Andreessen Horowitz** and **Radical Ventures**, with the business valued at over $1 billion. World Labs recently secured approximately $100 million in its latest fundraising round.
4. Li's vision for spatial intelligence aims to train AI systems capable of understanding complex physical world dynamics and object interrelationships within three-dimensional spaces, potentially revolutionizing autonomous systems and computer vision technology.
5. World Labs joins other AI startups like Skild in attracting investor interest by developing intelligent robots that can understand and manipulate their surround ings.

In summary, Fei-Fei Li's new venture, World Labs, has quickly gained significant traction within the tech industry, securing substantial funding from top investors to develop spatial intelligence in AI systems. This innovation could lead to major advancements in autonomous systems and computer vision technology by enabling machines to better understand and interact with real-world environments.
