英镑在英美经济数据超预期后飙升至一年最高位

英国经济增长和美国通货膨胀意外：英镑达到对美元一年以来的最高水平，因为英国经济出现意外增长，美国通货膨胀率低于预期。

由于数据显示英国经济在5月增长0.4%，而4月则持平，英镑上升至2023年7月以来的最高水平，达到1.2947美元。这一增长为新的工党政府提供了早期提振，该政府将经济扩张作为其“国家使命”优先考虑。

美国通货膨胀和美元下跌：随着6月通货膨胀率降至3%，低于预期，美元全面下挫。因此，英镑因美元下跌而上涨0.5%，达到1.2907美元，与一篮子六种货币相比表现良好。

英格兰银行降息猜测：英格兰银行在8月份降息的可能性已经减少，因为掉期市场的交易员现在对这一可能性意见不一，而早期的预测则表明降息的可能性为三分之二。

新工党政府和政治稳定：英镑走强归功于新工党政府的第一周表现，投资者欢迎政治稳定的前景。根据UBS投资银行的Shahab Jalinoos的说法，“英国在未来五年内可能成为G7国家中最稳定的国家之一”。

投资者情绪和市场立场：最近的积极发展促使包括黑岩投资研究所在内的资产管理公司将英国股票的战术立场从“中立”调整为“超配”。这一转变基于这样一种信念，即政治稳定和增长反弹可能会改善投资者情绪。

 **UK Economy Growth and US Inflation Surprises**: The pound reached a one-year high against the dollar after unexpected growth in the UK economy and lower than expected inflation rates in the US. 

The British currency rose to its highest level since late July 2023, reaching $1.2947 due to data showing that the UK's economy grew by 0 groth of 0.4% in May after flatlining in April. This growth has provided an early boost for the new Labour government, which prioritizes economic expansion as its "national mission."

**US Inflation and Dollar Decline**: The US dollar experienced a broad retreat following lower than expected inflation rates of 3% in June. Consequently, the pound was lifted by this decline, with the British currency trading up 0.5% at $1.2907 against a basket of six currencies.

**Bank of England Rate Cut Speculations**: The likelihood of an August interest rate cut by the Bank of England has decreased as traders in swaps markets are now evenly split on this possibility, compared to earlier predictions that suggested a two-thirds chance of a rate cut.

**New Labour Government and Political Stability**: Sterling's strength is attributed to the first week of the new Labour government, which has been welcomed by investors due to hopes for political stability. The UK now boasts "arguably the most stable government in the G7 over the next five years," according to Shahab Jalinoos from UBS Investment Bank.

**Investor Sentiment and Market Positions**: Recent positivity has led asset managers, including BlackRock's Investment Institute, to move their tactical position on UK stocks from "neutral" to "overweight." This shift is based on the belief that political stability and a growth pick-up could improve investor sentiment.
