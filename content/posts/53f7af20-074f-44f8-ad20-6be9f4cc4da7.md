福特股价下跌，因汽车维修费用影响利润

# 福特股价下跌，因保修费用上升

- **股价大幅下跌**：福特在报告了远低于分析师预期的第二季度业绩后，股价出现显著下跌。未预见到的修复缺陷车辆的保修费用激增是导致这种下降的主要原因。
- **每股收益为 46 美分**，而 FactSet 调查的分析师预计为每股收益 68 美分。
- **保修费用**：多年来，福特一直难以控制保修费用，现在面临着第二季度保修费用意外增加的问题。公司股价在盘后交易中下跌近 12%。
- **挑战**：由于折扣增加和高利率使汽车价格不菲，美国汽车制造商面临艰难的处境。此外，对福特电动汽车的需求也在放缓。
- **质量改进**：尽管存在这些挑战，但福特的新车在上市后的前三个月出现的问题较少，表明未来的保修费用可能会下降。
- **与竞争对手的比较**：福特调整后的运营利润比 2023 年第二季度下跌了 26%，而竞争对手通用汽车报告其调整后的运营利润增加了 37%。

 **Ford Shares Drop Amidst Rising Warranty Costs**  

- **Shares fall sharply:** Ford's shares experienced a significant drop after reporting second-quarter earnings that fell far below analyst expectations. The unexpected surge in warranty costs for fixing faulty vehicles was cited as the primary reason for this decline.
  - Adjusted earnings of **46 cents per share** were reported, compared to the anticipated **68 cents per share** by analysts polled by FactSet.
- **Warranty costs:** Ford has struggled with controlling warranty expenses for years and is now facing an unexpected increase in these costs during the second quarter. The company's shares were down nearly 12% in after-hours trading.
  - Warranty costs rose by **$800 million** from Q1 to Q2, which was not planned for.
- **Challenges faced:** US carmakers are facing difficult conditions due to increased discounts and high interest rates that make vehicles less affordable. Additionally, demand for Ford's electric vehicles is slowing down.
  - Chief Financial Officer John Lawler stated the hit to profits was "primarily about warranty."
- **Quality improvements:** Despite these challenges, Ford has seen fewer quality problems with new cars during their first three months on the road, suggesting that future warranty costs may decline.
  - The company is working towards cutting costs and reducing the number of models it produces to simplify manufacturing operations. However, Lawler acknowledged that this transformation process will be bumpy.
- **Comparison with competitors:** Ford's adjusted operating earnings fell by 26% compared to Q2 of 2023, while rival General Motors reported a 37% increase in its own adjusted operating earnings.
  - Despite the challenges faced this quarter, Ford reiterated its guidance for the year with expected adjusted operating earnings between **$10 billion and $12 billion**.
