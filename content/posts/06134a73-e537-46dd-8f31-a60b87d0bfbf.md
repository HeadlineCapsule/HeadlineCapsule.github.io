数十人死于以色列空袭针对哈马斯高级指挥官

**摘要：**

以色列空袭了据信是住有哈马斯高级指挥官穆罕默德·德伊夫和另一名高级领导人拉法·萨拉赫的复合体。巴勒斯坦卫生官员报告说，加沙南部有90多人死亡，数百人受伤。以色列官员声称这次袭击是基于“非常准确的情报”，但当时没有确认德伊夫或萨拉赫是否被杀死。

这些袭击发生在指定的人道主义“安全区”Al-Mawasi内，目标是哈马斯武装分子和该地区流离失所的巴勒斯坦人。以色列军队表示，他们不会犹豫地打击哈马斯建造的复合体，即使它们位于安全区内。

哈马斯否认德伊夫死亡，称其为“谎言”，而以色列估计大多数伤亡是与德伊夫和萨拉赫一起的恐怖分子。如果得到确认，这次袭击将标志着在持续了十个月的冲突中，被杀死的哈马斯最高级别官员。

 **Summary:**

Israeli air strikes targeted a compound believed to house top Hamas commander Mohammed al-Deif and another senior leader, Rafa'a Salameh. Palestinian health officials reported over 90 fatalities with hundreds injured in southern Gaza. Israeli officials claimed the attack was based on "very accurate intelligence," but there was no confirmation of Deif or Salameh being killed at that time.

The strikes occurred within a designated Al-Mawasi humanitarian "safe zone" and targeted both Hamas operatives and displaced Palestinians in the area. The Israeli military stated they would not hesitate to strike compounds built by Hamas, even if located within the safe zone.

Hamas denied Deif's death, calling it a "lie," while Israel estimated most casualties were terrorists accompanying Deif and Salameh. If confirmed, this attack would mark the highest-ranking Hamas official killed in the ongoing conflict, now in its tenth month.

**Key Points:**

- Israeli air strikes targeted a compound believed to house top Hamas commander Mohammed al-Deif and another senior leader, Rafa'a Salameh.
- Palestinian health officials reported over nine fatalities with hundreds injured in southern Gaza.
- The attacks occurred within the Al-Mawasi humanitarian "safe zone."
- Hamas denied Deif's death while Israel estimated most casualties were terrorists accompanying him and Salameh.
