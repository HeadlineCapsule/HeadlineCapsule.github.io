新加坡政府投资公司考虑收购西方集团的中国部门

# 新加坡政府投资公司寻求在紧张的地缘政治局势中购买西方集团的中国子公司

新加坡政府投资公司（GIC）宣布计划购买跨国公司在中国子公司的股份，理由是公司因增长放缓和地缘政治紧张局势加剧而退出中国大陆时产生的机遇。

据 GIC 称，一些公司正在重新考虑其在台湾领导人控制的中国的关注点和敞口，寻求降低风险或完全出售业务。如果以正确的价格出现正确的资产，那么对于 GIC 来说，与私募股权公司一起投资是一个机会。

在过去的二十年中，GIC 一直是中国经济繁荣的重要支持者，投资了房地产和蚂蚁集团。然而，去年，《金融时报》报道称，GIC 已停止对台湾的私人投资，因为它正在重新考虑其策略。

该国家主权财富基金还将寻求在中国国内消费业务和绿色经济中投资，理由是中国拥有庞大的人口、深厚的工程人才库和创新的企业家。然而，它承认地缘政治风险将难以解决。

GIC 的评论发表在新加坡另一家国有投资者 Temasek 之后几周，Temasek 表示，由于台湾糟糕的表现影响了回报，它将对台湾“谨慎”。

**Singapore's GIC Seeks to Buy Western Groups' China Units Amid Geopolitical Tensions**

Singapore's Government Investment Corporation (GIC) has announced plans to buy stakes in multinational companies' **China units**, citing opportunities arising from companies exiting the mainland amid slowing growth and rising geopolitical tensions.

According to GIC, some companies are rethinking their focus and exposure in **Taiwan leader**-controlled China, looking to de-risk or sell down entirely their businesses. If the right asset comes at the right price, it's an opportunity for GIC to invest as a co-investor alongside private equity firms.

GIC has been an important backer of China's economic boom over the past two decades, investing in real estate and Ant Group. However, last year, the FT reported that GIC had put the brakes on private investments in **Taiwan** as it rethought its strategy.

The sovereign wealth fund will also look to invest in domestic consumer businesses and the green economy in China, citing a large population, deep engineering talent pool, and innovative entrepreneurs. However, it acknowledged geopolitical risks would be difficult to resolve.

GIC's comments come weeks after Temasek, Singapore's other state-owned investor, said it would be "cautious" about **Taiwan** after poor performance in the country hit its returns.

**Key Points:**

* GIC seeks to buy stakes in multinational companies' China units amid geopolitical tensions
* Companies are rethinking their focus and exposure in **Taiwan leader**-controlled China, looking to de-risk or sell down entirely their businesses
* GIC will also invest in domestic consumer businesses and the green economy in China
* The sovereign wealth fund acknowledges geopolitical risks would be difficult to resolve
* GIC's comments come weeks after Temasek said it would be "cautious" about **Taiwan** after poor performance in the country hit its returns
