卡玛拉·哈里斯竞选团队寻求与加密货币公司“重置”关系

# 简要新闻摘要：

**卡玛拉·哈里斯（Kamala Harris）副总统的竞选团队正寻求与顶级加密货币公司改善关系，在民主党和拜登政府受到该行业批评后，希望与其关系“重置”。她的团队已联系了Coinbase、Circle和Ripple Labs等领先的加密货币公司。目标不仅是吸引新的选举捐款，而是建立建设性的关系，以帮助为这一资产类别的增长制定明智的监管框架。哈里斯希望改变民主党反商业的看法，将他们定位为“支持商业、负责任的商业”。该活动利用这一机会与科技行业重置关系，并赢得那些因潜在的新税收或法规而疏远的支持。

 **Summary:** 
Vice-president Kamala Harris's campaign is seeking to improve relations with top cryptocurrency companies, aiming for a "reset" in their relationship after criticism from the industry towards the Democratic party and the Biden administration. Her team has reached out to leading crypto firms such as Coinbase, Circle, and Ripple Labs. The objective is not solely focused on attracting new electoral contributions but rather building a constructive relationship that would help set a smart regulatory framework for the asset class's growth. Harris wants to change the perception of Democrats being anti-business by positioning them as "pro-business, responsible business." The campaign is using this opportunity to reset relations with the tech industry and win back support from those who have turned away due to potential new taxes or regulations.
