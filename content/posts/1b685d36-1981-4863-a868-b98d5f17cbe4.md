据信俄罗斯是刺杀欧洲防长主谋

# 俄罗斯涉嫌策划暗杀欧洲最大军火商高管

**俄罗斯**被认为与企图暗杀**莱茵金属**（Rheinmetall）首席执行官阿敏·帕珀格（Armin Papperger）的阴谋有关。该公司是欧洲最大的军火制造商。据称，这次阴谋是俄罗斯针对北约欧洲成员国的破坏和混合攻击运动的一部分。

德国政府为帕珀格提供了与总理奥拉夫·朔尔茨（Olaf Scholz）相同的“高度安全”措施。美国情报机构发现了这一阴谋，并通知了德国当局，从而挫败了这次企图。

当帕珀格在2023年宣布计划在乌克兰建造豹式坦克工厂时，俄罗斯外交部威胁要摧毁该工厂，这引起了克里姆林宫的愤怒。

西方情报机构已警告俄罗斯加大了对欧洲破坏活动的尝试，包括针对德国军事基地的阴谋。尽管这些警告很严重，但德国政府仍希望在华盛顿举行的北约峰会上淡化帕珀格事件。

莱茵金属在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后迅速扩大了生产能力，预计明年将生产约70万发炮弹，而2022年仅为7万发。尽管面临生命威胁，帕珀格仍表现出信心。

美国国家安全委员会正认真对待俄罗斯日益严重的颠覆活动，并与北约盟国密切合作，揭露和破坏这些活动。

 **Summary of Article:**

- Russia is believed to be behind a foiled plot to assassinate Armin Papperger, the CEO of Rheinmetall, Europe's largest arms manufacturer. The alleged conspiracy is part of Russia's wider sabotage and hybrid attack campaign against European Nato states.

- German government has provided "great level of security" around Papperger, similar to that of Chancellor Olaf Scholz. US intelligence uncovered the plot and alerted German authorities who were able to foil it.

- The Kremlin's ire was drawn in 2n3 when Papperger announced plans to build a Panther tank factory in Ukraine, which Russian foreign ministry threatened to destroy.

- Western intelligence services have warned of Russia's increased sabotage attempts in Europe, including plots targeting military bases in Germany. Despite the gravity of these warnings, German government is keen to play down Papperger developments at Nato summit in Washington.

- Rheinmetall has rapidly expanded its production capacity in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and will produce about 700,000 rounds of artillery next year compared with just 70,000 in 2022. Papperger remains confident despite the alleged threat to his life.

- The US National Security Council is taking Russia's intensifying campaign of subversion seriously and working closely with Nato allies to expose and disrupt these activities.
