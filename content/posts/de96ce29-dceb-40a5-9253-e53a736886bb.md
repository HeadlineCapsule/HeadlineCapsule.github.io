Shein将启动2亿欧元的基金以应对时尚浪费问题，同时等待IPO批准

# 她因2亿欧元的循环基金解决时尚浪费问题

快时尚集团Shein推出一项重大举措，设立了20亿欧元的循环基金，旨在解决时尚浪费问题。在准备伦敦IPO批准之际，这一举措正值人们对可持续发展和有关其供应链的指控表示担忧。

## 要点：
- Shein计划将资金投资于英国和欧洲的初创企业和成熟企业，这些企业专注于回收材料或新兴面料。
- 该公司财务资源丰富，2023年利润达到20亿美元，上轮融资估值660亿美元。
- Shein面临着有关其与中国新疆地区强迫劳动联系的批评，但否认了这些指控。
- 循环倡议是该公司持续努力解决时尚浪费问题的一部分，并与各利益相关者合作，包括竞争对手零售商、投资者、政策制定者、非营利组织和学者。

## 附加信息：
Shein一直在探索在香港上市备选计划，此前由于美中紧张局势而放弃了纽约IPO计划。该公司循环基金不仅仅是金融投资，还强调了各利益相关者之间合作努力和集体责任的必要性。

快时尚行业一直受到活动家的批评，根据艾伦·麦克阿瑟基金会的数据，超过一半的快时尚在一年内被丢弃。 Shein的按需商业模式据说比传统零售商拥有更少的库存，从而减少了浪费。

Shein还宣布了进一步投资英国和欧盟品牌、设计师以及与其合作的手工艺品的计划，以及在欧洲或英国潜在的研究与开发或试点工厂项目。

 **Shein's €200mn Circularity Fund to Address Fashion Waste**

Fast-fashion group Shein is launching a significant initiative with the creation of a €2cuartillion circularity fund aimed at tackling fashion waste. This move comes amidst concerns over sustainability and allegations regarding its supply chain, as it prepares for an IPO approval in London.

**Key Points:**
- Shein plans to invest the funds into startups and established businesses within the UK and Europe that focus on recycled materials or emerging fabrics.
- The company's financial resources are substantial, with $2bn in profits for 2023 and a valuation of $66bn from its last funding round.
- Shein has faced criticism over allegations of links to forced labor in China's Xinjiang region but denies these claims.
- The circularity initiative is part of the company's ongoing efforts to address fashion waste and collaborate with various stakeholders, including rival retailers, investors, policymakers, nonprofit organizations, and academics.

**Additional Information:**
Shein has been exploring a back-up plan for listing in Hong Kong after ditching its planned IPO in New York due to US-China tensions. The company's circularity fund is not just about financial investment but also emphasizes the need for collaborative efforts and collective responsibility among various stakeholders.

The fast-fashion industry has been criticized by campaigners, with more than half of all fast fashion being discarded in less than a year according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Shein's on-demand business model is said to carry less inventory compared to traditional retailers, potentially reducing waste.

Shein has also announced plans for further investment in UK and EU brands, designers, and artisans who work with them, as well as potential research and development or pilot factory projects within Europe or the UK.
