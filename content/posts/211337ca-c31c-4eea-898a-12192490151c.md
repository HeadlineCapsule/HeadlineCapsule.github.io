英国养老金计划向基金管理人多支付了15亿英镑费用

# 英国养老金计划多支付了15亿英镑的费用

ClearGlass，一家数据分析公司，最近的一项分析显示，英国养老金计划为其基金产品支付的费用比竞争对手高出14倍。该研究发现了资产管理公司向定义福利（DB）养老金计划收取“极端”费用的情况，并强调了购买相同基金的不同客户之间的定价差异很大。

## 主要发现：
- 由于基金管理费缺乏透明度，英国DB养老金计划每年多支付15亿英镑。
- 一些方案为其产品支付的费用比其他方案高出14倍，有些客户有效地补贴了向其他客户提供的价格。
- 该研究考察了688个私人和地方政府养老基金的实际价格，这些基金代表着5,500亿英镑的资产，横跨629名管理人员和38,000种基金策略。

## 对养老金的影响：
支付给资产管理公司的费用可能会显著影响退休时储户的最终支付金额。然而，具体的费用通常不会被透露出来，导致许多计划在不知不觉中为其投资多支付了费用。ClearGlass去年的分析发现，英国养老基金可以在向资产管理公司支付的费用上节省约20亿英镑。

## 行业回应：
金融行为监管局（FCA）通过标准化的基金成本披露提高了价格透明度，旨在促进养老金受托人之间的竞争。投资协会（IA），代表基金管理公司，声称由于严格的监管和加强成本披露的举措，英国是投资最低成本的国家之一。

## 建议：
养老金计划受托人有法律义务了解其计划的费用以及储户资金如何被投资。养老金监管局敦促受托人与顾问联系，阅读新的通用代码，并确保他们清楚自己的职责。

 **UK Pension Plans Overpay £1.5bn in Fees**  
A recent analysis by ClearGlass, a data analytics company, has revealed that UK pension plans pay up to 14 times more for the same fund product than their rivals. The study found an "extreme" range of charges by asset managers to defined benefit (DB) pension plans and highlighted significant disparities in pricing among clients purchasing identical funds.

**Key Findings:**  
- UK DB pension plans are overpaying £1.amo annually due to a lack of transparency in fund manager fees.
- Some schemes pay up to 14 times more for the same product than others, with some clients effectively subsidizing prices offered to other clients.
- The research examined actual prices paid by 688 private and local government pension funds representing £550bn in assets across 629 managers and 38,000 fund strategies.

**Impact on Pensions:**  
The fees paid to asset managers can significantly affect the eventual payouts to savers in retirement. However, precise charges are not typically revealed, leading many schemes to unknowingly overpay for their investments. Last year's analysis by ClearGlass found that UK pension funds could save about £2bn in fees paid to asset managers across various markets.

**Industry Response:**  
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has increased price transparency through standardized fund costs disclosure, aiming to boost competition among pension trustees. The Investment Association (IA), representing fund managers, claims that the UK is one of the lowest-cost countries for investments due to strict regulation and initiatives enhancing cost disclosure.

**Recommendations:**  
Pension scheme trustees have a legal obligation to understand costs incurred by their schemes and how savers' money is being invested. The Pensions Regulator urges trustees to engage with advisers, read the new general code, and ensure they are clear about their duties.
