泰坦尼克号建造者哈兰德和沃尔夫寻求新贷款以求生存

**哈兰德与沃尔夫**（Harland & Wolff）是著名的泰坦尼克号建造商，目前正面临财务危机，正在向其华尔街贷款人 Riverstone Credit Partners 寻求紧急贷款。该公司正在与 Riverstone 谈判，以确保将其现有 1.15 亿美元信贷额度延长 2000 万英镑。

这项潜在的融资可能导致该公司董事会内部发生重大变化，并可能导致 H&W 首席执行官 John Wood 离职。如果新资金协议失败，哈兰德与沃尔夫可能会被拆分并出售。英国政府一直密切参与这场危机的管理。

在透露英国工党政府可能拒绝 H&W 的 2 亿英镑贷款担保请求后，这些讨论的紧迫性增加了，该担保本将帮助他们从商业银行获得低息资金。前保守党政府曾就这项担保进行了一年多的谈判，但由于财政部的反对而未能做出最终决定。

哈兰德与沃尔夫（Harland & Wolff）的财务稳定性至关重要，因为它雇佣了 1500 名员工，分布在贝尔法斯特、德文州的 Appledore、苏格兰的 Methil 和 Arnish 的四个地点。这些潜在的工作岗位损失引起了英国工会的关注。

首席财务官 Arun Raman 向董事们透露，该公司正处于筹集额外资金的高级阶段，并预计很快将做出公开宣布。他还敦促他们向员工、供应链合作伙伴和其他人保证公司的财务状况。

工党政府对 John Wood 领导下的 H&W 管理层存在担忧，John Wood 在 2019 年该公司倒闭后带领该公司进行了 600 万英镑的救助。尽管赢得了建造新皇家海军船只的 16 亿英镑合同，并预测本财年收入为 2 亿英镑，但哈兰德与沃尔夫（Harland & Wolff）的未审计账目显示，上个财年的运营亏损为 2471 万英镑。

由于未能发布已审计账目，该公司自 7 月以来一直停牌，并强调了尽快获得贷款担保的重要性。在传出新政府可能不会批准 2 亿英镑贷款担保的消息后，哈兰德与沃尔夫（Harland & Wolff）发表声明，称该文章为猜测性报道。

北爱尔兰经济部长 Conor Murphy 表示支持 H&W 工人，并敦促英国国务大臣 Hilary Benn 在与他讨论时保护他们的利益。

 **Harland & Wolff**, the shipbuilder known for constructing the Titanic, is currently facing a financial crisis as it see.seks an emergency loan from its Wall Street lender, Riverstone Credit Partners. The company is in talks to secure a £20mn extension of its existing $115mn credit facility with Riverstone.

The potential financing may lead to significant changes within the company's board and could result in the departure of H&W chief executive John Wood. If the new funding agreement fails, Harland & Wolff might be broken up and put up for sale. The UK government has been closely involved with the management during this crisis.

The urgency of these discussions increased after it was revealed that the UK's Labour government is likely to reject a £200mn loan guarantee request from H&W, which would have helped them secure lower-interest funding from commercial banks. The previous Conservative government had been negotiating this guarantee for over a year but never reached a final decision due to objections raised by the Treasury.

The financial stability of Harland & Wolff is crucial as it emploebs 1,500 workers across four sites in Belfast, Appledore in Devon, and Methil and Arnish in Scotland. The potential loss of these jobs has raised concerns among British unions.

Chief Financial Officer Arun Raman informed directors that the company is at an advanced stage of raising additional financing and expects to make a public announcement soon. He also urged them to reassure their workforce, supply chain partners, and others about the company's financial situation.

There are concerns within the Labour government regarding H&W management under John Wood, who led the £6mn rescue of the company in 2019 after its collapse into administration. Despite winning part of a £1.6bn contract to build new Royal Navy ships and forecasting revenues of £200mn for this financial year, Harland & Wolff's unaudited accounts suggest an operating loss of £24.71mn for the last financial year.

The company has suspended its shares since July due to a failure to publish audited accounts and emphasized the importance of securing the loan guarantee as soon as possible. After news broke that the new government might not approve the £200mn loan guarantee, Harland & Wolff released a statement calling the article speculative.

Northern Ireland's Economy Minister Conor Murphy has expressed support for H&W workers and urged British Secretary of State Hilary Benn to protect their interests during discussions with him.
