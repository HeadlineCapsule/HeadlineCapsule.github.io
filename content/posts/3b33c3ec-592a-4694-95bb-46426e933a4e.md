维旺迪正在寻求在伦敦上市其流媒体服务Canal+

**维旺迪** 是一家法国媒体巨头，正在考虑将其流媒体服务 **Canal+** 在伦敦上市，这是该公司分拆成四个独立业务单元计划的一部分。该公司于去年12月宣布了这一意图，并一直在探索所有拟创建实体（包括Canal+和哈瓦斯广告业务）的各种上市选项。

亿万富翁文森特·博洛雷是维旺迪的最大股东。虽然尚未就伦敦上市地点做出最终决定，但阿姆斯特丹仍然是一个可能性。维旺迪董事会尚未就旨在解决其股价与企业价值之间巨大折扣的四分拆协议达成一致。

预计维旺迪管理层将在未来几个月向其监督委员会提交分拆的最终计划，雅尼克·博洛雷（文森特的儿子）表示，“目前没有重大障碍”。在分手后，还需要做出关于在哪里上市哈瓦斯的决定。

Canal+在伦敦或阿姆斯特丹上市将比维旺迪在巴黎的现有 Euronext 上市提供更多的国际资本渠道，因为Canal+的大部分观众都在法国以外，并且它即将收购非洲最大的付费电视运营商MultiChoice。作为购买 MultiChoice 交易的一部分，无论Canal+的首选市场如何，都已承诺在南非进行二次上市。

2024 年，尽管欧洲首次公开募股出现复苏，但英国 IPO 市场仍然很平静。其他公司，如在线快时尚巨头 Shein，也在探索伦敦上市。维旺迪拒绝对此事发表评论，彭博社首先报道了Canal+在英国上市的可能性。

 **Vivendi**, a French media conglomerate, is considering a potential **London listing** for its streaming service, **Canal+**, as part of its plan to split into four separate business units. The company announced this intention in December and has been exploring various listing options for all the entities it plans to create, including Canal+ and its Havas advertising business.

Billionaire Vincent Bolloré is Vivendi's largest shareholder. While no final decision has been made regarding the London listing venue, Amsterdam remains a possibility as well. The board of Vivendi has not yet reached an agreement on the four-way split aimed at addressing the large discount between its share price and the value of its businesses.

Vivendi's management is expected to submit final plans for the split to its supervisory board in the coming months, with Yannick Bolloré (son of Vincent) stating that there are "no major obstacles right now." A decision also needs to be made about where to list Havas after the break-up.

A listing for Canal+ in London or Amsterdam would provide more access to international capital than Vivendi's current Euronext listing in Paris, as a majority of Canal+'s viewers are outside France and it is set to take over MultiChoice, Africa's largest pay-television operator. A secondary listing in South Africa for Canal+ has been committed as part of the deal to buy MultiChoice, regardless of its primary market choice.

The UK IPO market has remained quiet despite a recovery in European initial public offerings during 2024. Other companies like online fast-fashion giant Shein are also exploring London listings. Vivendi declined to comment on the matter, with Bloomberg first reporting the possibility of a UK listing for Canal+.
