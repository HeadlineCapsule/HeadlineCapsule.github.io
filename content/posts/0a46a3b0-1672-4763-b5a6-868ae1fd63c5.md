联合国抨击企业过度依赖碳信用额度来实现气候目标

# 联合国推动企业减少排放，而不是依赖碳信用额度

联合国（UN）发布了一份政策草案，反对公司依靠碳信用额度来抵消其温室气体排放。这份由联合国全球碳市场特别工作组准备的文件认为，企业应该投资于减少自身排放，而不是依赖于数亿美元的碳交易市场。

**要点：**

* **碳信用额度受批评**：联合国草案批评公司利用碳信用额度在国家监管计划之外抵消排放。
* **敦促企业减少排放**：联合国认为，企业应该投资于减少自身排放，而不是依赖碳交易市场。
* **瞄准大污染企业**：雪佛龙（Chevron）和埃克森美孚（ExxonMobil）等公司以及微软（Microsoft）和苹果（Apple）等科技巨头已将碳抵消纳入了他们向投资者做出的气候承诺。
* **预计碳信用市场增长**：行业人士预计碳信用市场将增长，估计到本十年结束时，该市场每年可能达到100亿美元至400亿美元。

**行业反应：**

* **英国石油（BP）的杰夫·斯沃茨（Jeff Swartz）**：“我希望并且期待致力于保护生态系统的严肃组织……不会关闭一条引导碳融资的途径。”
* **预计市场增长**：尽管联合国表示反对，但行业人士预计碳信用市场将增长。

**联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯（António Guterres）的立场：**

* **关注排放削减**：古特雷斯强调了公司和投资者需要专注于削减自身排放，并避免可疑的抵消或碳信用额度。

**UN Pushes for Corporate Emissions Cuts Over Carbon Credits**

The United Nations (UN) has released a draft policy document opposing companies' reliance on carbon credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. The document, prepared by the UN task force on global carbon markets, argues that corporations should invest in reducing their own emissions rather than relying on the multimillion-dollar carbon trading market.

**Key Points:**

* **Carbon Credits Under Fire**: The UN draft document criticizes companies' use of carbon credits to cancel out their emissions outside of state-regulated schemes.
* **Corporate Emissions Cuts Urged**: The UN believes that companies should invest in ways to curb their own emissions, rather than relying on the carbon trading market.
* **Big Polluters Targeted**: Companies such as Chevron and ExxonMobil, as well as technology giants like Microsoft and Apple, have included carbon offsetting in their plans to meet climate promises made to investors.
* **Carbon Credit Market Growth Expected**: Industry figures expect the carbon credit market to grow, with estimates suggesting it could reach between $10bn and $40bn a year by the end of the decade.

**Industry Reaction:**

* **BP's Jeff Swartz**: "I would hope and I would expect that serious organisations that are committed to protecting ecosystems . . . don't shut down an avenue for channelling that carbon finance."
* **Industry Figures Expect Market Growth**: Despite the UN's opposition, industry figures expect the carbon credit market to grow.

**UN Secretary-General António Guterres' Stance:**

* **Focus on Emissions Cuts**: Guterres has emphasized the need for companies and investors to focus on cutting their own emissions and avoiding dubious offsets or carbon credits.
