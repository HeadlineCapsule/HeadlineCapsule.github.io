杰夫·贝索斯将出售价值50亿美元的亚马逊股票

杰夫·贝索斯计划大规模出售股票

科技巨头杰夫·贝索斯（Jeff Bezos）准备出售其公司近50亿美元的股票，使今年出售的股票总价值超过134亿美元。根据监管文件显示，7月份将出售2500万股亚马逊股票。

尽管贝索斯在2021年卸任首席执行官一职，但他仍然是亚马逊的重要股东，持有该公司约四分之一的股份，并继续担任执行董事长。在亚马逊加入微软和谷歌母公司字母表（Alphabet）成为市值超过2万亿美元的美国科技公司之后，贝索斯决定出售股票。

亚马逊的股价今年上涨了三分之一，这得益于投资者对人工智能推动其云计算部门增长的潜力感到兴奋。然而，亚马逊的市值仍落后于英伟达、苹果和微软等公司，这些公司的市值都超过了3万亿美元。

贝索斯于1994年创立亚马逊，最初是一家图书销售公司，如今已发展成为电子商务、云计算、视频流媒体、医疗保健等多个领域的帝国。自不再负责亚马逊日常运营以来，贝索斯专注于其他创业项目，如他的太空公司蓝色起源（Blue Origin）和美国报纸《华盛顿邮报》。

除了最近的股票出售外，贝索斯今年还出售了少量股票用于慈善事业，例如他创立的蒙台梭利教育非营利组织Day 1 Academies。亚马逊于2月披露，贝索斯计划通过经纪人摩根士丹利（Morgan Stanley）在2025年1月底前出售多达5000万股股票。

亚马逊目前正在进行领导层调整，马特·加曼（Matt Garman）接替亚当·塞利普斯基（Adam Selipsky）担任云业务部门负责人，后者自4月以来已出售了超过300万美元的亚马逊股票。

 **Jeff Bezos Plans Massive Share Sale**  

Tech giant Jeff Bezos is set to offload almost $5bn worth of shares from his company, bringing the total he has sold this year to more than $13.4bn. The sale will see him divest 25mn Amazon shares in July, as disclosed in regulatory filings.

Despite stepping down as CEO in 2021, Bezos remains a significant shareholder with approximately a cuarter of the company's stake and continues to serve as its executive chair. The sale comes after Amazon joined Microsoft and Google’s parent Alphabet as one of the US tech companies whose market capitalization has surpassed $2tn.

Amazon shares have risen by a third in the year, driven by investor excitement about artificial intelligence's potential to catalyze growth in its cloud division. However, Amazon still trails behind chipmaker Nvidia, iPhone maker Apple, and Microsoft, all of which have crossed the $3tn threshold.

Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 as a bookselling company that has since grown into an empire spanning ecommerce, cloud computing, video streaming, healthcare, and more. Since stepping back from running Amazon, Bezos has focused on other ventures such as his space group Blue Origin and US newspaper The Washington Post.

In addition to the recent share sale, Bezos has sold smaller amounts of shares this year to finance charitable ventures like Day 1 Academies, an educational Montessori-inspired nonprofit he founded. Amazon disclosed in February that Bezos intended to sell up to 50mn shares by the end of January 2025 via broker Morgan Stanley.

Amazon is currently undergoing a leadership shakeup with Matt Garman replacing Adam Selipsky as head of its cloud business, who has sold more than $3mn worth of Amazon stock since April.
