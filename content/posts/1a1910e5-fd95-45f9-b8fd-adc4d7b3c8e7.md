诺华警告前列腺癌药物价格将保持高位

# 诺华（Novartis）维持新前列腺癌药物的高价格并私售给无法负担的医疗系统

瑞士制药公司诺华宣布，其最近开发的前列腺癌治疗药物**Pluvicto**将继续保持高价格。该公司财务主管表示，由于生产流程成本高且供应链要求复杂，如果医疗系统无法或不愿支付该药物的费用，则仅通过私下渠道提供该药物。

这种新的**放射性药物疗法**Pluvicto属于一种可以延长癌症患者生命但价格昂贵的治疗方法。在美国，每支药物的挂牌价约为42500美元，而治疗周期可能需要多达6次剂量。然而，由于成本问题，一些欧洲医疗系统选择不提供这种药物。

诺华首席财务官**Harry Kirsch**强调了制造Pluvicto同时保持竞争力价格所面临的挑战。他表示，如果某些国家或医疗系统无法负担预定的价格，诺华将在有良好接受度的地方私售该药物。

尽管价格高昂，但Pluvicto的销售额在6月份之前的前6个月增长了45%，达到6.55亿美元，其中大部分收入来自美国市场。然而，第二季度的销售额低于分析师的预测，促使Kirsch提到有必要教育医疗专业人员了解Pluvicto的好处，以增加转诊。

Pluvicto是一种高度针对性的放射疗法，使用一种称为钐-177的放射性成分，其半衰期短，需要在制造后立即使用，并在美国、意大利和西班牙的诺华站点生产。通过在印第安纳州开设一家新工厂，解决了药物供应紧张的问题，实现了不受限制的供应。

尽管Pluvicto获得了英国药品和医疗保健产品监管局以及欧盟委员会的批准，但由于成本问题，并非所有欧洲国家都提供这种治疗方法。德国最近宣布，它将通过法定健康保险基金报销每年超过15万欧元的药物费用，而英国国民保健服务（NHS）尚未批准其使用，因为与当前治疗方法相比，其成本效益存在不确定性。

诺华面临着其他制药集团的竞争，例如阿斯利康和勃林格殷格翰，它们最近进入了精确放射疗法领域。尽管如此，由于今年上半年心脏衰竭、银屑病和癌症药物的强劲销售，诺华提高了年度利润指导。

总之，由于生产复杂性和供应链挑战，**诺华**将继续以高价格出售Pluvicto。该公司致力于提供这种创新治疗方法，同时也寻求保护其投资价值。

 **Novartis** maintains high price for new prostate cancer drug and sells privately if health systems cannot afford it  

Swiss pharmaceutical company **Novartis** has announced that its recently developed prostate cancer treatment, **Pluvicto**, will continue to be sold at a high price point. The company's finance chief stated that the drug would only be made available privately if health systems are unable or unwilling to pay for it due to its costly production process and complex supply chain requirements.

The new **radiopharmaceutical therapy**, Pluvicto, is part of a growing class of treatments that can extend the lives of cancer patients but come with high price tags. The US list price stands at approximately $42,500 per dose, and treatment cycles may require up to six doses. However, some European health systems have opted not to offer this drug due to its cost.

**Harry Kirsch**, Novartis's chief financial officer, emphasized the challenges of manufacturing Pluvicto while maintaining a competitive price point. He stated that if certain countries or health systems cannot afford the set price, Novartis will sell it privately where there is good uptake.

Despite its high cost, sales for Pluvicto have risen by 45% in the six months leading up to June, reaching $655 million with a significant portion of that revenue coming from the US market. However, second-quarter sales were lower than analysts' forecasts, prompting Kirsch to mention the need for educating medical professionals about Pluvicto's benefits in order to increase referrals.

Pluvicto is a highly targeted form of radiotherapy that uses a radioactive component called lutetium-177, which has a short half-life and requires immediate use after manufacturing at Novartis sites across the US, Italy, and Spain. The drug's supply constraints have been addressed with the opening of a new facility in Indiana, allowing for unconstrained supply.

While Pluvicto has received approval from both the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the European Commission, not all European countries are providing this treatment due to cost concerns. Germany recently announced that it would reimburse the drug at a price of over €150,000 per year through statutory health insurance funds, while the UK's National Health Service has yet to approve its use based on uncertain cost-effectiveness compared to current treatments.

Novartis faces competition from other pharmaceutical groups that have entered the precision radiotherapy sector recently, such as AstraZeneca and Bristol Myers Squibb. Despite this, Novartis raised its annual profit guidance after strong sales of heart failure, psoriasis, and cancer drugs in the first half of the year.

In summary, **Novartis** will continue to sell Pluvicto at a high price point due to production complexities and supply chain challenges. The company is committed to making this innovative treatment available but also seeps to protect its investment value.
