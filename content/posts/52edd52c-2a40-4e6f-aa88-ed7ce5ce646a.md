巴克莱银行要求高等法院阻止被动基金投资者诉讼

# 巴克莱银行试图驳回投资者5.6亿英镑的诉讼

**巴克莱银行** 已要求高等法院减少投资者提出的5.6亿英镑的诉讼，并驳回被动基金关于其股价因监管机构对其“**暗池交易**”的审查而下跌的主张。该银行辩称，这些被动基金自动根据市场指数购买股票，并没有受到误导，因为它们没有阅读贷款人的披露信息。

**关键点：**
- 巴克莱银行面临投资者提出的5.6亿英镑的诉讼，理由是关于其“暗池交易”的“**虚假陈述**”。
- 该银行试图驳回被动基金的主张，辩称它们没有受到误导，因为这些基金不会阅读贷款人的披露信息，并且根据市场指数自动交易。
- 海伦·戴维斯（Helen Davies）代表巴克莱银行出庭，而乔纳森·纳斯（Jonathan Nash）则代表股东。
- 法官的决定将影响指数追踪基金是否能参与针对英国公司股价下跌的其他诉讼。
- 股东于2020年提起诉讼，声称巴克莱向市场做出了“不真实”或“误导性”的陈述。
- 该银行希望驳回价值约3.3亿英镑（超过总金额一半）的242只基金和子基金的主张。
- 由安联和富达管理的公司是起诉巴克莱的投资者，他们因2014年的损失而受到影响。
- 2016年，巴克莱同意支付7000万美元，作为与证券监管机构和解的一部分，承认了重大误导。

 **Summary:** Barclays Bank has requested the High Court to reduce a £560 million lawsuit from investors by dismissing claims made by passive funds regarding a drop in its share price due to regulatory scrutiny over its "dark pool" trading exchange. The bank argues that these passive funds, which automatically buy shares based on market indices, were not misled as they did not read the lender's disclosures.

**Key Points:**
- Barclays Bank is facing a £560 million lawsuit from investors over alleged "false representations" about its dark pool trading exchange.
- The bank seeks to dismiss claims made by passive funds, arguing they were not misled as these funds do not read the lender's disclosures and trade automatically based on market indices.
- Helen Davies KC represents Barclays Bank in court, while Jonathan Nash KC acts for shareholders.
- The judge's decision will impact whether index tracking funds can participate in other lawsuits against UK companies over share price declines.
- Shareholders filed the lawsuit in 2020, claiming Barclays made "untrue" or "misleading" statements to the market.
- The bank wants to strike out claims of 242 funds and sub-funds valued at about £330 million (more than half the total amount).
- Passive funds managed by Amundi and State Street are among investors suing Barclays over losses sustained in 2014.
- In 2016, Barclays agreed to pay $70 million as part of a settlement with the Secureby accepting material misrepresentations.
