分析显示，联合国气候峰会东道国阿塞拜疆未能解决燃气燃烧问题

# 联合国气候峰会东道主阿塞拜疆的燃气燃烧情况加剧

**文章摘要：**

联合国气候峰会东道主阿塞拜疆的燃气燃烧情况加剧，尽管该国负责主办COP29。根据全球见证组织利用卫星数据进行的分析，自2018年以来，石油和天然气设施的燃气燃烧量增加了10.5%。BP公司和国营公司Socar运营或拥有的设施也促成了燃气燃烧活动的增加。

**要点：**

- 自2018年以来，阿塞拜疆的燃气燃烧量增加了10.5%，这是二氧化碳、甲烷排放和黑色烟雾的主要来源。
- BP和Socar设施的燃气燃烧活动增加，尽管他们承诺到2030年消除这种做法。
- 甲烷是导致过去二十年的全球变暖的三分之一的原因，被认为是限制近期气候变化最有效的方法之一。超过155个国家签署了到2030年将甲烷排放量减少30%的承诺，包括阿塞拜疆。
- 全球燃气燃烧量接近年度纪录水平，2023年燃烧了1480亿立方米的天然气。
- 活动家和政治家们质疑一个化石燃料生产国是否适合主办世界上最重要的气候变化峰会。

**主要关切：**

- 阿塞拜疆作为COP29的主办国，燃气燃烧活动增加，尽管承诺到2030年消除石油和天然气生产中的这种做法。
- 该国自2016年以来未能报告排放数据，引发了透明度和问责制的担忧。
- 全球见证组织发现，阿塞拜疆的燃气燃烧率在六年内增加了70%以上，多个BP设施对这一上升趋势贡献巨大。

 **Article Summary:**  
The UN climate summit host, Azerbaijan, has seen a significant increase in gas flaring activities despite being responsible for hosting COP29. According to an analysis by Global Witness using satellite data, the volume of flared gas at oil and gas installations increased by 10.5% since 2018. Facilities operated or owned by BP and state-owned Socar were among those contributing to this rise in flaring activities.

**Key Points:**  
- Gas flaring, a major source of carbon dioxide, methane emissions, and black soot, has increased by 10.5% since 2018 in Azerbaijan.
- BP and Socar facilities have seen an increase in gas flaring activities despite pledges to eliminate the practice by amoeba 2030.  
- Methane, responsible for about a third of human-caused warming over the past two decades, is considered one of the most effective ways to limit climate change in the near term. Over 155 countries have signed a pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, including Azerbaijan.
- Global gas flaring remains at nearly annual record levels, with 148 billion cubic meters flared in 2023.  
- The appropriateness of a fossil fuel-producing nation hosting the world's most important climate change summit has been questioned by campaigners and politicians.

**Main Concerns:**  
- Azerbaijan, as host for COP29, has seen an increase in gas flaring activities despite pledges to eliminate it from oil and gas production by 2030.  
- The country's failure to report its emissions data since 2016 raises concerns about transparency and accountability.  
- Global Witness found that the rate of gas flaring in Azerbaijan had increased more than 70% over six years, with several BP facilities contributing significantly to this rise.
