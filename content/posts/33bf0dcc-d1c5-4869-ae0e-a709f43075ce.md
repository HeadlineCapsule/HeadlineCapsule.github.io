投资者为泰晤士水务100亿英镑的债务降级做准备

# 投资者准备应对泰晤士水公司 100 亿英镑债务降级为垃圾级别的可能性

**摘要：**
投资者谨慎对待泰晤士水公司（Thames Water）100 亿英镑债务可能被降级为垃圾级别，这可能会增加监管监督并影响欧洲高收益债券市场。标准普尔（S&P）警告称，该公用事业公司可能无法维持足够的流动性，导致其最安全类别的债券从 BBB-投资级降级为垃圾级别。这可能会触发水务监管局 Ofwat 的干预，并提高泰晤士水公司的借贷成本，该公司已经背负着 180 亿英镑的债务负担。

**要点：**
- S&P 可能因流动性问题而将泰晤士水公司超过 100 亿英镑的最安全类别债券降级为垃圾级别。
- 降级可能导致加强监管监督，并影响欧洲高收益债券市场，因为泰晤士水公司占斯特林高收益指数约 11%。
- 为遵守许可证规定，该公司必须维持两个投资级评级或寻求 Ofwat 的例外。
- 穆迪（Moody's）也对泰晤士水公司最低可能的投资级评级债券做出负面展望。
- 降级可能增加借贷成本，并给该公司带来压力，该公司正努力应对 180 亿英镑的债务负担。
- 该公司需要在明年 5 月筹集 7.5 亿英镑股本，并在 2030 年之前再筹集 25 亿英镑。
- 由于泰晤士水公司的现有股东已宣布该公司“不可投资”，因此不确定他们是否能够成功在秋季筹集债务和股本。
- 降级可能会触发 Ofwat 启动特别管理程序，这是一种临时国有化的形式。

**影响：**
泰晤士水公司债券的潜在降级可能对该公司、其投资者和欧洲高收益债券市场产生重大影响。加强监管监督可能会导致 Ofwat 的干预，而更高的借贷成本将给已经陷入困境的公用事业公司带来更多压力，该公司背负着 180 亿英镑的债务负担。此外，泰晤士水公司需要在未来几个月和几年内筹集股本，但其现有股东已宣布该公司“不可投资”，这使此事变得不确定。降级还可能影响欧洲高收益债券市场，因为泰晤士水公司占斯特林高收益指数相当大的份额。

 **Summary:**  
Investors brace for potential downgrade of £10bn Thames Water debt to junk status, which may increase regulatory scrutiny and impact Europe's high-yield bond market. S&P has warned that the utility company might not maintain adequate liquidity, leading to a possible downgrade of its safest class of bonds from BBB- investment grade to junk status. This could trigger intervention by regulator Ofwat and raise borrowing costs for Thames Water, which already struggles with £18bn debt pile.

**Key Points:**  
- S&P may downgrade over £10bn of Thames Water's safest class bonds to junk status due to liquidity concerns.
- Downgrade could result in greater regulatory scrutiny and impact Europe's high-yield bond market, as Thames Water accounts for about 11% of the sterling high-yield index.
- The company needs to maintain two investment-grade ratings or seek an exception from Ofwat to comply with its license.
- Moody's also assigns a negative outlook on Thames Water's lowest possible investment-grade rating bonds.
- A downgrade could increase borrowing costs and pressure the company, which is already struggling under its £18bn debt pile.
- The company needs to raise equity by £750mn in May next year and a further £2.5bn by 2030.
- Thames Water's existing shareholders have declared the company "uninvestable," making it unclear whether they will succeed in raising debt and equity this autumn.
- The downgrade could trigger Ofwat to initiate special administration, which is a form of temporary renationalization.

**Implications:**  
A potential downgrade of Thames Water's bonds may have significant implications for the company, its investors, and Europe's high-yield bond market. The increased regulatory scrutiny could lead to intervention by Ofwat, while higher borrowing costs would add pressure on an already struggling utility provider with a £18bn debt pile. Additionally, Thames Water needs to raise equity in the coming months and years, but its existing shareholders have declared it "uninvestable," making this uncertain. The downgrade could also impact Europe's high-yield bond market, as Thames Water accounts for a significant portion of the sterling high-yield index.
