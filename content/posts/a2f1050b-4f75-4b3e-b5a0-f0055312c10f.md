市场重新评估“特朗普交易”后乔·拜登退出竞选

# 市场对乔·拜登退出美国总统竞选并支持卡玛拉·哈里斯的反应各不相同，投资者评估了这对“特朗普交易”的影响。

一些与特朗普胜利相关的市场走势，如更陡峭的收益率曲线、较弱的墨西哥比索和地区银行股上涨，最初出现逆转，但后来稳定下来。预测市场显示特朗普获胜的可能性略有下降，而国库券收益率在宣布前水平上下波动。股票市场反应平淡，与共和党胜利相关的交易出现小幅逆转。在海外销售额更高的公司表现优于国内重点公司，墨西哥比索对美元走强。总的来说，投资者仍然认为特朗普占优，尽管拜登退出了竞选。

## 关键点：

1. 投资者重新评估了“特朗普交易”，这是乔·拜登退出并支持卡玛拉·哈里斯后的结果。
2. 市场走势最初出现逆转，但后来稳定下来，国库券收益率在宣布前水平上下波动。
3. 股票市场反应平淡，与共和党胜利相关的交易出现小幅逆转。
4. 在海外销售额更高的公司表现优于国内重点公司；墨西哥比索对美元走强。
5. 尽管拜登退出了竞选，投资者仍然认为特朗普占优。

 **Summary:** 
Market reactions to Joe Biden's withdrawal from US presidential race and endorsement of Kamala Harris were mixed as investors assessed the impact on "Trump trades." Some market moves associated with a Trump victory, such as steeper yield curve, weaker Mexican peso, and regional bank stock rally, initially reversed but later stabilized. Prediction markets showed slight decline in Trump's odds of winning, while Treasury yields fluctuated before returning to pre-announcement levels. Stock market reactions were subdued with minor reversals in trades tied to a Republican victory. Companies generating higher overseas sales outperformed domestic-focused ones, and the Mexican peso strengthened against the dollar. Overall, investors still perceive Trump as having an advantage despite Biden's withdrawal from the race.
