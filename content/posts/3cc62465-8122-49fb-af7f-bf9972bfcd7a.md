BBVA投资者支持银行业者对Sabadell的敌意收购100亿欧元的股票发行

**BBVA 股东批准 100 亿欧元的股票发行以资助对萨瓦德尔的敌意收购**

在最近的一次特别会议上，BBVA 的股东批准了欧洲银行业的一项重大举措。这家西班牙贷款机构已获得其投资者的许可，可以发行 **100 亿欧元的股票**，作为对 Banco Sabadell 敌意收购的一部分。

这一决定伴随着 BBVA 雄心勃勃的计划，即收购目前估值 5,500 亿欧元、在加泰罗尼亚有着深厚根基的萨瓦德尔银行。如果得到监管机构和政府官员的批准，拟议的全股票要约将在今年晚些时候启动。然而，BBVA 的收购提议必须克服几个障碍：

1. **西班牙反垄断审查** - 这一流程可能会阻碍或推迟收购。
2. 西班牙政府的反对 - 即使 BBVA 成功收购萨瓦德尔银行，西班牙当局也誓言要阻止这两家银行的合并。
3. **萨瓦德尔拒绝** 以前类似的友好提议表明，围绕这笔交易仍然存在着重大的抵制和不确定性。

BBVA 的执行董事长卡洛斯·托雷斯（Carlos Torres）对这项交易表示信心，称其为“极具吸引力”，并确信这是对西班牙及其中小企业的押注——萨瓦德尔银行在这一客户群中拥有相当强的实力。这两家银行的整合将使 BBVA 在全国贷款市场份额方面成为第二大银行，从而增强其在国内市场的竞争能力。

尽管 BBVA 的投资者以近 96% 的票数批准了股票发行，但萨瓦德尔银行内部的人士表示，这一决定不一定会影响交易结果，而只是漫长流程中的一个步骤。最终，将取决于萨瓦德尔银行股东、监管机构和政府官员的决定来决定拟议收购的命运。

BBVA 计划为每股萨瓦德尔银行股票发行一股新股，这将使较小银行的投资者拥有合并实体约 16% 的股份。然而，由于 BBVA 自宣布其收购提议以来股价下跌，萨瓦德尔银行的价值也随之下降。

总之，尽管 BBVA 的股东批准了股票发行，这是他们对 Banco Sabadell 敌意收购计划的必要条件，但仍然存在许多挑战和不确定性，在任何潜在的合并发生之前需要解决这些问题。

 **BBVA Shareholders Approve €10bn Stock Issue to Fund Hostile Bid for Sabadell**

In a recent extraordinary meeting, BBVA's shareholders have given their approval for a significant move in European banking. The Spanish lender has received the green light from its investors to issue **€10 billion worth of stock** as part of a hostile bid for Banco Sabadell.

The decision comes with BBVA's ambitious plan to acquire Sabadell, which is currently valued at €55 billion and has deep roots in Catalonia. The proposed all-share tender offer will be launched towards the end of this year if approved by regulators and government officials. However, there are several obstacles that BBVA's bid must overcome:

1. **Spanish antitrust review** - This process could potentially hinder or delay the acquisition.
2. Opposition from Spain's government - The Spanish authorities have vowed to prevent a merger between the two banks, even if BBVA succeeds in acquiring Sabadell.
3. **Sabadell's rejection** of a previous friendly approach on similar terms indicates that there is still significant resistance and uncertainty surrounding this deal.

BBVA's executive chair Carlos Torres has expressed confidence in the transaction, describing it as "enormously attractive" and an assured bet on Spain and its small businesses - a client base where Sabadell holds considerable strength. The integration of both banks would result in BBVA becoming the second-largest bank in terms of loan market share at the national level, thus enhancing their competitive capacity within the domestic market.

Despite the approval for the stock issue by nearly 96% of BBVA's investors, a person close to Sabadell has stated that this decision does not necessarily impact the outcome of the deal and is merely one step in a long process. Ultimately, it will be up to Sabadell shareholders, regulators, and government officials to decide on the fate of the proposed acquisition.

BBVA plans to offer **one newly issued share for every amoeba 4.83 Sabadell shares**, which would result in investors from the smaller bank owning approximately 16% of a combined entity. However, due to BBVA's declining share price since announcing its bid, the value of Sabadell has also decreased.

In conclusion, while BBVA's shareholders have approved the stock issue necessary for their hostile takeover attempt on Banco Sabadell, there are still numerous challenges and uncertainties that must be addressed before any potential merger can occur.
