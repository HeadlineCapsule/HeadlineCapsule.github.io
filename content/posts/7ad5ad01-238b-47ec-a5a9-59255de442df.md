美国特勤局局长因唐纳德·特朗普遇刺案辞职

**美国特勤局局长因未能阻止唐纳德·特朗普的暗杀未遂案而辞职**

美国特勤局局长金伯利·奇特勒（Kimberly Cheatle）在对该机构未能阻止前总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的暗杀未遂案负责后辞职。这一决定是在她面临来自国会议员的强烈批评之后做出的，批评的原因是发生在拍摄事件之前的安全疏忽。

**要点：**

* 在特朗普在宾夕法尼亚州演讲之前几分钟，执法部门将枪手托马斯·克罗克斯（Thomas Crooks）认定为“可疑”。
* 尽管克罗克斯携带了一支步枪测距仪，这被确定不是禁止物品，但并不一定被视为威胁。
* 特勤局仍然不知道克罗克斯是如何获得他从屋顶向特朗普和人群开火的准入权限的。
* 奇特勒承认，该机构的安全护送没有完全满足特朗普团队对更多保护的一些要求。

**反应：**

众议院监督委员会主席詹姆斯·科默（James Comer）批评了奇特勒的领导，并誓言将有“更多的问责制”。总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）在声明中感谢奇特勒几十年的公共服务。唐纳德·特朗普指责拜登政府未能妥善保护他，声称他被迫“为民主挡子弹”。

**背景：**

奇特勒的辞职标志着她近30年的安全服务生涯的结束，此前曾在百事可乐公司工作。该事件引发了对特勤局保护知名人士的能力以及该机构内部加强问责制必要性的质疑。

**US Secret Service Director Resigns Over Security Failings in Donald Trump Assassination Attempt**

The US Secret Service director, Kimberly Cheatle, has resigned after accepting responsibility for the agency's failure to prevent an assassination attempt on **Donald Trump**, the former president. The decision comes a day after she faced intense scrutiny from lawmakers over security lapses that occurred ahead of the shooting.

**Key Points:**

* The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was identified as "suspicious" by law enforcement several minutes before Trump took to the stage in Pennsylvania.
* Despite carrying a rifle rangefinder, which was deemed not a prohibited item, Crooks was not necessarily considered a threat.
* The Secret Service was still unaware of how Crooks gained access to the roof from which he fired towards Trump and members of the crowd.
* Cheatle admitted that the agency's security detail did not fully meet some requests for more protection by Trump's team.

**Reactions:**

* James Comer, Republican chair of the House oversight committee, vowed there would be "more accountability to come" after criticizing Cheatle's leadership.
* President Joe Biden thanked Cheatle for her decades of public service in a statement.
* Donald Trump blamed the Biden administration for not properly protecting him and claimed he was "forced to take a bullet for democracy".

**Context:**

The resignation marks an end to almost 30 years of service in the security services for Cheatle, who had previously worked at PepsiCo. The incident has raised questions about the Secret Service's ability to protect high-profile individuals and the need for greater accountability within the agency.
