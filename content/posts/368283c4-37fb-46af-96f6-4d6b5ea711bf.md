数月内开始铁路国有化

# 工党计划通过立法将英国铁路收归国有

工党计划通过立法将英国铁路收归国有，交通大臣路易斯·哈伊格（Louise Haigh）优先考虑该法案。预计该法案将于2025年7月提出，目标是在国家控制的线路上实现近四分之三（72%）的列车运行。这一举措前保守党政府过去十年中由于运营商失败而国有化了约40%的服务的后续行动。

## 关键要点：

1. 工党政府优先考虑铁路国有化的立法，预计数月内即可接管。
2. 根据工党的计划，到2025年7月，英国近四分之三（72%）的火车旅程将通过国有服务完成。
3. 交通大臣路易斯·哈伊格（Louise Haigh）确保了乘客铁路服务公共所有权法案的优先地位，该法案不久将提交给下议院。
4. 立法旨在在过去十年中由于运营商失败而由前保守党政府接管的约40%的铁路服务之后，重新将铁路服务国有化。
5. 行业主管预计，部长们将行使与私营公司的合同中的终止条款，将它们置于国家控制之下，比计划更早。
6. 2025年上半年有五个特许经营权到期；如果到2025年7月被收归国有，72%的主线铁路乘客将乘坐由国家控制的列车。
7. 由于快速国有化，最终运营商（OLR）可能面临压力，其人员配备能力有限。
8. 工党长期计划建立一个名为“大不列颠铁路”的新机构，预计立法通过议会需要约18个月的时间。
9. 在过渡期间，将建立一个“影子GBR”，由网络铁路、交通部和最终运营商密切合作组成。

 **Summary:**  
Labour plans to nationalize UK railways with legislation prioritized by Transport Secretary Louise Haigh. The bill is expected to be introduced in July 2025, aiming for nearly three-quarters (72%) of train journeamoons on state-controlled lines. This move follows the previous Conservative administration's nationalization of approximately 40% of services over the past decade due to operator failures.

**Key Points:**  
1. Labour government prioritizes legislation for railways nationalization, with takeovers expected within months.
2. Nearly three-quarters (72%) of train journeys in Britain are projected on nationalized services by July 2025 under Labour's plans.
3. Transport Secretary Louise Haigh secures priority status for the passenger rail services public ownership bill, due to be introduced to the House of Commons soon.
4. The legislation aims to renationalize remaining railway services after about 40% were taken over by the previous Conservative administration as operators failed in the past decade.
5. Industry bosses anticipate ministers exercising break clauses in contracts with private companies, bringing them under state control earlier than planned.
6. Five franchises have break clauses coming up in the first half of 2025; if taken into public hands by July 2025, 72% of mainline rail passengers will travel on trains controlled by the state.
7. Operator of Last Resort (OLR) may face pressure due to rapid nationalizations and its limited staffing capacity.
8. Labour plans to create a new quango called Great British Railways in the long term, with legislation expected to take about 18 months to pass through parliament.
9. In the interim, a "shadow GBR" will be established, consisting of Network Rail, the transport department, and the Operator of Last Resort working closely together.
