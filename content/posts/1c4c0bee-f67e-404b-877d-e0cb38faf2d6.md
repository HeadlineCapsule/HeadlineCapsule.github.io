欧盟瞄准中国的时尚电商巨头特步和谢恩，提出征收进口关税

**欧盟提议对中国在线零售商征收进口关税**

欧洲委员会计划对从中国在线零售商购买的廉价商品征收进口关税，包括特卖和谢恩。这一举措旨在应对进入欧盟市场的劣质商品激增的问题。

要点：
- 布鲁塞尔正在考虑取消当前 1 欧元的门槛，低于该门槛，商品免征海关关税。
- 主要目标包括中国的在线市场特卖和阿里巴巴，以及服装零售商谢恩。
- 2021 年，有超过 23 亿件商品以低于 150 欧元的免税门槛进口到欧盟。
- 拟议措施将适用于任何直接从欧盟以外发货给欧盟消费者的在线零售商。
- 其他选择包括对大型平台的强制性增值税注册以及对发送到欧盟公司的所有包裹的强制性增值税付款，无论价值如何。

欧洲委员会的提议是对市场上危险产品的担忧作出的回应，据报道，从 2022 年到 2023 年，此类事件增加了超过 50%。欧洲玩具工业协会发现，特卖购买的 19 件玩具中没有一件符合欧盟标准，对儿童存在安全隐患。

虽然一些行业团体，如 EuroCommerce，认为现行立法充足，但需要有效的跨境执法战略，但中国零售商特卖、阿里巴巴和谢恩表示支持符合消费者利益并遵守欧盟法规的政策调整。

 **EU Proposes Import Duty on Chinese Online Retailers**

The European Commission is planning to impose import duties on cheap goods purchased from Chinese online retailers, including Temu and Shein. The move aims to address the surge of substandard items entering the EU market. 

Key points:
- Scrapping the current €1n threshold below which goods are exempt from customs duties is being considered by Brussels.
- Main targets include China's online marketplaces Temu and AliExpress, as well as clothing retailer Shein.
- In 2021, over 2.3 billion items were imported into the EU below the duty-free threshold of €150.
- The proposed measures would apply to any online retailer shipping directly from outside the bloc to EU customers.
- Additional options include mandatory VAT registration for large platforms and compulsory VAT payments on all packages sent to EU companies, regardless of value.

The European Commission's proposal comes as a response to concerns over dangerous products entering the market, with reported incidents increasing by more than 50% from 2022 to 2023. The Toy Industries of Europe group found that none of the 19 toys purchased from Temu complied with EU standards and posed safety risks for children.

While some industry groups, such as EuroCommerce, believe existing legislation is sufficient but requires an effective cross-border enforcement strategy, Chinese retailers like Temu, AliExpress, and Shein have expressed support for policy adjustments that align with consumer interests and comply with EU regulations.
