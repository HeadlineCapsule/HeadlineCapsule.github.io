民主党顶级金主和操作员称乔·拜登即将离职

**摘要：**
民主党的主要捐赠者、操作员和党内人士正在向乔·拜登施加压力，要求他退出2024年白宫竞选，称他面临着“不可逾越”的压力而退出。这一推动是由于一系列对他的竞选产生负面影响的事件，包括与共和党人围绕唐纳德·特朗普的集会形成的有害分割屏幕，以及拜登最近的新冠病毒检测呈阳性。

**要点：**

1. **民主党大金主**，从华尔街到好莱坞，正在敦促党领袖查克·舒默、哈基姆·杰弗里斯和南希·佩洛西说服拜登退出竞选。
2. 人们描述对拜登的压力是“不可逾越”的，并预测他可能在周一甚至更早退出。
3. 一项最近的CBS-YouGov民意调查显示，特朗普领先拜登5个百分点，其他民意调查表明，自上个月拜登与特朗普的辩论以来，对拜登的支持率有所下降。
4. 捐赠者、筹款者和操作员中存在一种观点，即几乎整个国会代表团、大多数捐赠者和绝大多数基础选民都认为拜登应该让步，因此，迫使总统退出民主党票的压力正在增加。
5. 一些高级党派人士收到了来自顶级民主党贡献者的信息，敦促他们公开呼吁拜登退出竞选。
6. 尽管受到这种压力，拜登竞选发言人昆廷·福克表示，拜登和特朗普都将留在竞选中。
7. 一些党内人士认为，捐赠者的威胁可能对让拜登下台起到反作用。

 **Summary:**  
Major Democratic donors, operatives, and party insiders are pressuring Joe Biden to exit the 2024 White House race, citing an "insurmountable" pressure for him to quit. The push comes after a series of events that have negatively impacted his campaign, including a damaging split-screen with Republicans rallying around Donald Trump and Biden's recent positive Covid test.

**Key Points:**  
1. **Democratic megadonors** from Wall Street to Hollywood are urging party leaders like Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and Nancy Pelosi to persuade Biden to drop out of the race.
2. The pressure on Biden is described as "insurmountable," with predictions that he may exit by Monday or even earlier.
3. A recent CBS-YouGov poll shows Trump leading Biden by five points, and other polls indicate a decline in support for Biden since his debate performance against Trump last month.
4. The pressure to force the president off the Democratic ticket is gaining speed among donors, bundlers, and operatives who believe that nearly the entire congressional delegation, most of the donors, and a large majority of base voters think Biden should step aside.
5. Some senior party figures have received messages from top Democratic contributors urging them to go public with new calls for Biden to drop out of the race.
6. Despite this pressure, Biden campaign spokesperson Quentin Fulks stated that both Biden and Trump are staying in the race.
7. Some party insiders believe that threats by donors might be counterproductive in getting Biden to step down.
