Meta解除对唐纳德·特朗普的Facebook和Instagram账户限制

**元宇宙解除限制**，唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的Facebook和Instagram账户恢复使用。在2024年选举活动紧张之际，这位美国前总统继续批评社交媒体平台。Meta此前因2020年选举舞弊指控和对1月6日国会山暴乱者的称赞而冻结了特朗普的账户，现在决定解除加重的停权处罚。

Meta的理由是美国人民应该能够平等听到美国总统候选人的声音。该公司最初于2023年1月恢复了特朗普的账户，并添加了额外的安全措施来阻止违规内容，但现在这些措施已被取消，因为Meta认为它们因“极端和非凡的情况”而变得不必要。

特朗普指责社交媒体集团通过围绕选举完整性和错误信息的内容审核政策来压制保守派的声音。作为2024年竞选活动的一部分，他誓言如果当选，将 desmantle 他所说的“审查卡特尔”。尽管对特朗普的限制被解除，但Meta仍坚持所有美国总统候选人都受其禁止仇恨言论和煽动暴力政策的约束。

特朗普主要使用Truth Social作为他的选择平台，但自停权解除后，他也在Facebook和Instagram上定期发布帖子。他最近加入了竞争对手TikTok，由字节跳动公司拥有，尽管他在X上只发布了一次。

 **Meta lifts restrictions** on Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts as the former US president continues his criticism of social media platforms amidst intensifying 2cuation for the 2024 election campaign. The decision to lift heightened suspension penalties comes after Meta had previously frozen Trump's accounts due to claims about a rigged 2020 election and praise for Capitol stormers on January 6, 2021.

**Meta's rationale** is that the American people should be able to hear from presidential nominees on an equal basis. The company had initially reinstated Trump's accounts in January 2023 with additional guardrails to deter rule-breaking content, but these have now been removed as Meta deems them unnecessary due to "extreme and extraordinary circumstances."

Trump has accused social media groups of silencing conservative voices through moderation policies around election integrity and misinformation. As part of his 2024 campaigning, he vows to dismantle what he calls a "censorship cartel" if elected. Despite lifting restrictions on Trump's accounts, Meta maintains that all US presidential candidates remain subject to its policies against hate speech and incitement to violence.

Trump has primarily used Truth Social as his platform of choice but has also begun posting regularly on Facebook and Instagram since the suspension was lifted. He recently signed up for rival TikTok, owned by ByteDance, although he has only posted once on X.
