科技亿万富翁马克·平克斯加入捐赠者推动，迫使乔·拜登下台

科技亿万富翁马克·平克斯（Mark Pincus）加入越来越多民主党捐赠者的行列，敦促乔·拜登退出总统竞选，因为他在有影响力的支持者中支持率下降。 Zynga的创始人马克·平克斯（Mark Pincus）认为，开放会议将允许一位年轻候选人出现并提高民主党在11月击败唐纳德·特朗普的机会。

平克斯认为，拜登面临着年龄和能力问题的挑战。他提出，开放会议是民主党的最佳选择，可以为比赛注入新能量，有几个强大的球员可以取代拜登，例如密歇根州的格雷琴·惠特默（Gretchen Whitmer）和加利福尼亚州的加文·纽瑟姆（Gavin Newsom）。

在前众议院议长南希·佩洛西和演员乔治·克鲁尼表示拜登正在失去党有影响力的成员的支持后，这一干预行动就出现了。几名民主党国会议员也呼吁拜登退出竞选，而随着有关他未来竞选前景的动荡，竞选资金似乎也在枯竭。

尽管存在这些担忧，乔·拜登仍致力于留在比赛中，并表示他会“击败特朗普”。然而，像波士顿房地产投资者乔治·克鲁普这样的捐赠者敦促他退出了，因为民意调查和摇摆州的前景都不利于他。

 **Tech billionaire Mark Pincus** joins a growing group of Democratic donors urging **Joe Biden** to exit the White House race as his support from influential backers dwindles. The founder of Zynga, **Mark Pincus**, suggests that an open convention would allow for a younger candidate who could revive Democrats' chances against Donald Trump in November.

Pincus believes Biden faces challenges due to his age and competency issues. He proposes an open convention as the best chance for the Democratic party to bring new energy into the race, with several strong players available to replace Biden, such as **Gretchen Whitmer** of Michigan and **Gavin Newsom** of California.

This intervention comes after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and actor George Clooney signaled that Biden is losing support among influential party members. Several Democratic Congress members have also called for Biden to drop out, while campaign funding appears to be drying up amidst the turmoil over his future in the race.

Despite these concerns, **Joe Biden** remains committed to staying in the race and has stated that he will "beat Trump." However, donors like Boston real estate investor George Krupp are urging him to quit due to unfavorable polls and battleground state prospects.
