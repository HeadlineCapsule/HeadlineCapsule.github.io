荷兰成立多元化右翼政府

一个由不同政治派别组成的右翼政府荷兰上台，首相迪克·斯霍夫领导。联盟包括格尔特·威尔德斯的极右翼政党自由党（PVV），该党获得了15个部长职位中的5个。值得注意的人选包括被任命为农业部长的费姆克·维尔斯马和被任命为贸易部长的莱因特·克莱弗。

由于一些有争议的人选在议会听证会上面临审查，例如支持“伟大替换”阴谋论，政府面临挑战。联盟中的其他两个政党——自由民主人民党（VVD）（自由/保守派）和新社会契约党（中心右翼）——旨在维持财政政策并鼓励投资。

前财政部官员埃尔科·海因恩被任命为新财长，重点是减少支出并寻求从2027年开始减少荷兰对欧盟预算的贡献。首相斯霍夫没有政治经验，但具备国家安全领域的专业知识。

尽管不是政府成员，但格尔特·威尔德斯的影响力仍然很大，因为他仍然可以塑造自己政党的形象并在必要时与该党保持距离。联盟党意识到他们需要有效地管理威尔德斯，以防止他破坏他们的政府。

 **Summary of Article:**

An eclectic right-wing government takes office in the Netherlands with Prime Minister Dick Schoof at its helm. The coalition includes Geert Wilders' far-right party, Freedom Party (PVV), which secured five out of 15 ministerial posts. Notable appointments include Femke Wiersma as agriculture minister and Reinette Klever for trade minister.

The government faces challenges with some controversial picks facing scrutiny in parliamentary hearings, such as endorsing the "Great Replacement" conspiracy theory. The other two parties in the coalition - VVD (liberal/conservative) and New Social Contract (centre-right) - aim to maintain fiscal policies and encourage investment.

Eelco Heinen, a former finance ministry official, is appointed as the new finance minister with a focus on reducing spending and seeking reductions in Dutch contributions to the EU budget from 2027. Prime Minister Schoof has no political experience but brings expertise in national security roles.

Geert Wilders' influence remains significant despite not being part of the government, as he can still shape his party's image and distance himself when necessary. The coalition parties are aware that they need to manage Wilders effectively to prevent him from destabilizing their government.
