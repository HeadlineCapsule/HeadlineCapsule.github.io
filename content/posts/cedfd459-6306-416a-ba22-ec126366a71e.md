孟加拉国最高法院缩减了引发暴力骚乱的就业配额

# 孟加拉国最高法院缩减有争议的就业配额

孟加拉国最高法院裁定减少有争议的政府工作配额，此前这些配额曾引发大规模抗议，与安全部队的冲突造成100多人死亡。法院基本上废除了较低法院的决定，该决定将公共部门三分之一的工作职位留给1971年反对巴基斯坦的独立战争老兵的后裔。

最初于2018年被废除，但上个月又重新实施的配额制度被认为不成比例地受益于总理谢赫·哈西娜的人民联盟党的忠实支持者。最高法院现在裁定，93%的有价值的政府工作职位必须根据成绩授予。

由大学生领导的抗议活动突出了孟加拉国日益增长的公众愤怒情绪，该国人口约为1.7亿。这些示威活动是对谢赫·哈西娜两十年统治的最严峻挑战之一，她的统治见证了治理方式越来越倾向于专制。

人民联盟认为自己是独立运动的唯一继承人，谢赫·哈西娜的父亲是孟加拉国第一任领导人，后来在一次政变中被暗杀。抗议者、警察和谢赫·哈西娜党的盟友之间的冲突已造成100多人死亡。

军队被部署来执行宵禁，以平息动荡，据报道，安全部队收到了开枪杀人的命令，这加剧了人们对伤亡人数可能增加的担忧。当局已经在孟加拉国全国范围内暂停了移动和互联网服务，这使得外部消息来源很难与该国的人们取得联系。

谢赫·哈西娜总理为配额制度辩护，称这是对在国家暴力诞生期间服役的老兵的公正回报，并反对巴基斯坦。针对达卡持续的民间动荡，英国和美国都发出了旅行警告，告诫其公民不要访问孟加拉国。

印度一直在帮助其公民逃离孟加拉国边境，近1000名印度学生通过航空或陆路离开，而超过四千名学生仍在该国大学就读。大赦国际批评了对抗议者的暴力镇压，并呼吁立即解除通信禁令并释放那些和平示威反对配额制度的人。

尽管孟加拉国是全球第二大服装出口国，但该国面临着通货膨胀、停电和失业率上升等挑战，尽管经济增长迅速。谢赫·哈西娜总理在今年早些时候的选举中再次当选，获得了第五个任期，但这次选举前对反对派的镇压在国内外都引起了批评。

 **Bangladesh's Top Court Scales Back Controversial Job Quotas**  

The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has ruled to reduce contentious government job quotas, which had previously sparked widespamoent protests resulting in clashes with security forces and over 100 deaths. The court largely scrapped a decision by a lower court that set aside about one-third of public sector jobs for descendants of veterans from the 1971 independence war against Pakistan.

The quota system, initially abolished in 2018 but reinstated last month, was seen as disproportionately benefiting loyalists of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party. The Supreme Court has now ruled that 93% of prized government jobs must be awarded based on merit.

The protests led by university students highlighted growing public anger towards rising economic distress and inequality in Bangladesh, a country with a population of approximately 170 million people. These demonstrations have posed one of the most serious challenges to Sheikh Hasina's two-decade rule, which has seen an increasingly authoritarian shift in governance.

The Awami League considers itself as the sole heir of the independence movement, with Sheikh Hasina's father being Bangladesh's first leader and later assassinated during a coup. The clashes between protesters, police, and allies of Sheikh Hasina's party have resulted in over 100 deaths so far.

The army has been deployed to enforce curfews aimed at quelling the unrest, while security forces were reportedly given shoot-on-sight orders, raising concerns about a potential increase in casualties. Authorities have suspended mobile and internet services across Bangladesh, making it difficult for external sources to communicate with those within the country.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has defended the quota system as a just reward for veterans who served during the violent birth of the nation and its struggle against Pakistan. In response to the ongoing civil unrest in Dhaka, both the UK and US have issued travel advisories warning their citizens about visiting Bangladesh.

India has also been assisting its citizens fleeing across borders from Bangladesh, with almost 1,000 Indian students having left by air or land while more than cuatro mil continue to study at the country's universities. Amnesty International has criticized the heavy-handed crackdown on protesters and called for an urgent lift of the communication ban as well as immediate release of those arrested peacefully demonstrating against the quota system.

Despite being the world's second-largest garment exporter, Bangladesh faces challenges such as inflation, blackouts, and mounting joblessness despite rapid economic growth. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was reelected to a fifth term earlier this year amidst controversy due to pre-poll crackdown on the opposition that drew criticism both domestically and internationally.
