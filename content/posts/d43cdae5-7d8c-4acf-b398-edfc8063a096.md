苹果寻求“杀手应用”来推动其3500美元的Vision Pro头戴式设备

# Apple的Vision Pro头显设备面临挑战：

**文章摘要：** 尽管苹果的Vision Pro头显设备定价高达3500美元，但仍在努力吸引开发人员为其创建新内容和“杀手级应用”。这款设备支持虚拟现实（VR）和增强现实（AR），但可用应用数量远低于iPhone和iPad最初几个月的数量。

**要点：**
- Apple的Vision Pro头显设备的应用数量不到2000个，而iPhone和iPad最初有超过100万个应用。
- 这款设备支持VR和AR体验，但缺乏“杀手级应用”。
- 开发人员因3500美元的高价位而犹豫不决。
- 一些开发人员相信苹果对该平台的承诺将长期获得回报。
- 预计一年或两年内会发布更便宜的版本，以扩大其市场影响力。

**挑战：**
- 头显设备的高成本使其无法为更广泛的消费者所接触，从而限制了潜在的应用购买和使用。
- 开发人员面临将其他VR平台（如Meta的Quest）的现有应用适应苹果独特硬件功能（如手部追踪）的挑战。

**机遇：**
- Vision Pro头显设备代表了技术的重大进步，提供了可能随着时间而变得更加主流的沉浸式体验。
- 早期投资该平台的开发人员可能会受益于苹果这一前沿设备的发展并可能获得更广泛的采用。

 **Article Summary:** Apple's Vision Pro headset struggles to attract developers for fresh content and a "killer app," despite its high price tag of $3,50curosn. The device shifts between virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), but the number of apps available is significantly lower than those created for iPhone and iPad in their first few months.

**Key Points:**
- Apple's Vision Pro headset has fewer than 2,000 apps compared to over a million on iPhone and iPad initially.
- The device offers both VR and AR experiences but lacks a standout "killer app."
- Developers are hesitant due to the high price point of $3,500 for the headset.
- Some developers believe that Apple's commitment to the platform will pay off in the long term.
- A cheaper version of Vision Pro may be released within the next year or two to expand its market reach.

**Challenges:**
- The high cost of the headset makes it less accessible for a broader consumer base, limiting potential app purchases and usage.
- Developers face challenges in adapting their existing apps from other VR platforms like Meta's Quest to work with Apple's unique hardware features such as hand tracking.

**Opportunities:**
- The Vision Pro headset represents a significant advancement in technology, offering immersive experiences that could become more mainstream over time.
- Developers who invest early in the platform may benefit from being on Apple's cutting-edge device as it evolves and potentially gains wider adoption.
