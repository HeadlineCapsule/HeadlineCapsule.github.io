桑树任命前甘尼公司首席执行官安德里亚·巴尔多为新首席执行官

**桑树任命前甘妮首席执行官安德烈亚·巴尔多为新首席执行官**

在奢侈时尚界的一件最新事中，**桑树** 宣布任命 **安德烈亚·巴尔多** 为新首席执行官，他是丹麦品牌甘妮的前首席执行官。这一决定是在 Thierry Andretta 从桑树职位上立即离职后做出的。

巴尔多在时尚界有着丰富经验，曾在 Coccinelle、Marni 和 Diesel 担任过职务。他的任命将于 9 月生效，因为他将专注于桑树的“下一章”。巴尔多的专长在于推动国际增长和加强品牌形象，这在他担任甘妮职务期间发挥了关键作用。

周二下午伦敦交易中，安达雷塔离职的消息导致桑树股价上涨 3.6%。然而，自 2021 年以来，该股票已下跌 72%，当时股价为 368 英镑，市值 6800 万英镑。

桑树最近遇到的困难包括年度销售额据报道下降了 4%，以及额外运营成本，导致今年早些时候伦敦邦德街店关闭。奢侈品行业的品牌命运各不相同，一些品牌如 Hermès 实现了增长，而其他品牌如 Gucci 所有者 Kering 则对利润发出了警告。

由体育用品大亨迈克·阿什利控制的弗拉斯集团（Frasers Group）是豪斯·奥夫·弗雷泽（House of Fraser）的重要供应商，持有桑树 36.8% 的股份。总部位于新加坡的翁家族持有 56% 的多数股份。

桑树主席克里斯·罗伯茨（Chris Roberts）称赞巴尔多在国际时尚品牌方面的专业知识、创造力和战略思维，使他成为带领公司进入下一个增长阶段的理想人选。

 **Mulberry Names Ex-Ganni Boss Andrea Baldo as New Chief Executive**

In a recent development within the luxury fashion industry, **Mulberry** announced that it appointed **Andrea Baldo**, former CEO of Danish brand Ganni, as its new chief executive. This decision comes after Thierry Andretta's immediate departure from his position at Mulberry.

Baldo has an extensive background in the fashion industry with previous roles at Coccinelle, Marni, and Diesel. His appointment is set to take effect in September, as he will be focusing on Mulberry’s “next chapter”. Baldo's expertise lies in driving international growth and sharpening brand identity, which has been instrumental during his tenure at Ganni.

The news of Andretta's departure led to a 3.6% increase in Mulberry shares on Tuesday afternoon trading in London. However, the stock has lost 72% of its value since 2021 when it was trading at 368p with a market capitalisation of £68mn.

Mulberry's recent struggles include a reported 4% decline in annual sales and additional operational costs, contributing to the closure of its Bond Street store in London earlier this year. The luxury sector has seen diverging fortunes among brands, with some like Hermès experiencing growth while others such as Gucci owner Kering have warned on profits.

Frasers Group, controlled by sportswear tycoon Mike Ashley and a significant supplier to House of Fraser, owns 36.8% of Mulberry shares. The Singapore-based Ong family holds the majority stake at 56%.

Mulberry's chair Chris Roberts praised Baldo for his international fashion brand expertise, creativity, and strategic thinking, making him an ideal candidate to lead the company into its next phase of growth.
