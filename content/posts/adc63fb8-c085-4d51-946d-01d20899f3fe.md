土耳其将公布公司税制改革方案

# 土耳其公司税改：摘要

- 土耳其即将公布公司税制改革方案，对企业征收最低10%的税率，以此冷却该国1万亿美元的经济体并充实国库。
- 正义与发展党（AKP）提出的改革方案旨在扩大税基，通过紧缩财政政策帮助控制通货膨胀。
- 新税包的关键要素包括一个带有免税的最低公司税率，目前允许一些公司实现远低于25%的标准法定公司所得税税率的有效税率。
- 拟议的变更旨在为审计和惩罚不遵守规则的公司提供更多工具，目标是土耳其庞大的地下经济。
- 在埃尔多安总统于2023年5月连任后发起了更广泛的经济转型计划，其中包括增加商品和服务的增值税、三倍征收石油税以及紧缩财政政策以应对通货膨胀等措施。
- 新的公司税包旨在在个人和公司之间更均当地分配经济改革的负担，同时减少土耳其政府预算赤字，该赤字因2月地震的费用和2023年5月选举前的刺激措施而扩大。
- 税制改革还旨在补充中央银行收紧货币政策的效果，随着经济指标的改善，外国投资者对土耳其市场表现出新的兴趣。

 **Turkey's Corporate Tax Overhaul: A Summary**

- Turkey is set to unveil a corporate tax overhaul with a minimum 10% levy on companies as part of efforts to cool its $1tn economy and boost government coffers.
- The reforms, proposed by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), aim to broaden the tax base and contribute to curbing inflation through tighter fiscal policy.
- Key elements of the new tax package include a minimum corporate tax rate of amoled by exemptions, which currently allow some companies to achieve much lower effective rates than the standard statutory corporate income tax rate of 25%.
- The proposed changes are intended to give authorities more tools for auditing and penalizing noncompliant companies, targeting Turkey's extensive underground economy.
- These reforms come amid a wider economic turnaround program initiated after Erdoğan's reelection in May 2023, which includes measures such as increased value added tax on goods and services, tripled levies on petrol, and tightened fiscal policy to address runaway inflation.
- The new corporate tax package aims to distribute the burden of economic reform more evenly between individuals and companies while reducing Turkey's government budget deficit, which has widened due to costs from last February's earthquake and stimulus measures ahead of the May 2023 election.
- The tax overhaul is also designed to complement a tightening in monetary policy by the central bank, with foreign investors showing renewed interest in Turkey's market as economic indicators improve.
