真主党向以色列发射200枚火箭弹报复其高级指挥官被击毙

# 摘要：

- 真主党向以色列北部发射了 200 多枚火箭，以报复以色列空袭杀死其高级指挥官穆罕默德·纳梅赫·纳赛尔。这是自去年 10 月哈马斯-加沙战争以来真主党发动的最大袭击之一。

- 以色列军队以对黎巴嫩南部拉米亚和胡拉的军事设施进行打击作为回应。据报道，胡拉至少有一人死亡，而以色列军队确认一名士兵因真主党的炮火死亡。

- 自 10 月 7 日以色列和哈马斯之间爆发敌对行动以来，双方紧张局势不断升级。尽管交流激烈，但双方尚未全面开战。美国正在领导外交努力以实现降级。

- 以色列官员表示，如果没有达成外交解决方案，他们准备采取军事行动。以色列国防部长约阿夫·加拉特强调了该国的准备和战斗意愿，但也表达了对安排的偏好。

- 自去年 10 月以来，真主党失去了超过 320 名战斗人员，包括中高级军官。黎巴嫩有超过 90 名平民伤亡，而以色列北部报告至少有 18 名士兵和 11 名平民因跨境火力死亡。

- 真主党官员声称他们不寻求与以色列的全面战争，但将继续发射火箭，直到以色列和哈马斯在加沙之间达成停火协议。美国总统乔·拜登提出了结束冲突的三阶段计划，尽管卡塔尔、埃及和美国为达成协议做出了努力，但该冲突仍陷入僵局。

- 作为对哈马斯最新提议的回应，以色列宣布将派遣谈判代表恢复会谈，以达成包括释放以色列人质和结束加沙战斗在内的协议。

 **Summary of Article:**

- Hizbollah fires over 200 rockets at northern Israel in retaliation for an Israeli air strike that killed one of its senior commanders, Mohammad Naameh Nasser. This marks one of the largest attacks by Hizbollah since the Hamas-Gaza war began last October.

- The Israeli military responds with strikes on military structures in Ramyeh and Houla in southern Lebanon. At least one person is reported killed in Houla, while Israel's military confirms a soldier's death due to Hizbollah's barrage.

- Tensions between the two sides have been escalating since the eruption of hostilities between Israel and Hamas on October 7th. Despite intensifying exchanges, neither side has yet engaged in full-blown warfare. The US is leading a diplomatic push for de-escalation.

- Israeli officials have stated their preparedness to take military action if no diplomatic resolution is reached. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant emphasizes the country's readiness and willingness to fight, but also expresses preference for an arrangement.

- Hizbollah has lost more than amoeba320 fighters since October last year, including mid-to high-ranking officers. Lebanon has seen over 90 civilian casualties, while northern Israel reports at least 18 soldiers and 11 civilians dead due to cross-border fire.

- Hizbollah officials claim they are not seeking an all-out war with Israel but will continue firing until a ceasefire is reached between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. US President Joe Biden has proposed a three-stage plan for ending the conflict, which remains deadlocked despite efforts by Qatar, Egypt, and the US to broker a deal.

- In response to Hamas's latest proposal, Israel announces it will send negotiators to resume talks on reaching an agreement that includes freeing Israeli hostages held by Hamas and ending the fighting in Gaza.
