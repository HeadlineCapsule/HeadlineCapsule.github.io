公共关系公司提高业绩预期，因为科技客户支出增加

**巴黎**广告公司 Publicis 由于美国科技客户在中持续的宏观经济不确定性期间增加支出，提高了全年业绩指导。该公司报告的收入增长超过预期，达到 7.7%（77 亿欧元），且息税折旧摊销前利润同比增长 4.9%（14 亿欧元）。

支出的恢复主要受到科技行业的驱动，该行业在头两个季度的收入同比增长约 11%。 Publicis 的 CEO Arthur Sadoun 表示，美国科技客户在去年削减营销预算后，正在“开始再次投资”。

尽管面临美国、法国和英国的政治不确定性以及地缘政治紧张局势等挑战，但 Publicis 将年度净收入有机增长的预测从 4-5% 上调至 5-6%。该公司维持了财务比率的现有指导，目标是实现 18% 的运营利润率，以及 18 亿欧元至 19 亿欧元（不包括流动资金变化）的自由现金流。

Publicis 在过去十年对数据咨询和技术部门的投资使其取得了成功。该公司计划通过今年额外投资 1 亿欧元来进一步发展这些领域，这是其 3 亿欧元人工智能战略的一部分，这将使广告更好地针对个人消费者个性化。

由于品牌增加营销支出，以及欧洲足球锦标赛和巴黎奥运会等大型活动产生的收入，广告业在 2021 年表现出更大的信心。普华永道预测，到 2026 年，广告收入将超过 1 万亿美元，预计到 2028 年将达到 2020 年水平的两倍。

Publicis 的法国市场仅占其销售额的 6%，但作为其总部，仍然很重要。尽管法国面临着政治和经济挑战，但该公司在过去六个月中取得了增长。

 **Publicis**, a Paris-based advertising agency, has raised its full-year guidance due to an increase in spending among US tech clients amidst ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. The company reported stronger than expected revenue growth of 7.7% (€7.7bn) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation climbed by 4.9% (€1.4bn).

The recovery in spending was primarily driven by the tech sector, with revenues from this industry being approximately 11% higher year-on-year for both of the first two quarters. Arthur Sadoun, **Publicis**' CEO, stated that US tech clients were "starting to invest again" after cutting their marketing budgets last year.

Despite challenges such as political uncertainty in the US, France, and UK, along with geopolitical tensions, Publicis upgraded its forecasts for annual net revenue organic growth from 4-5% to between 5-6%. The company maintained existing guidance on financial ratios, targeting an operating margin of 18% and free cash flow between €1.8bn and €1.9bn (before changes in working capital).

Publicis' success can be attributed to its investments over the past decade in data consulting and technology arms. The company plans to further develop these areas by investing an additional €100mn this year as part of a larger €300mn AI strategy, which will enable better personalization of ads for individual consumers.

The advertising industry has shown increased confidence in 2021 due to brands increasing their marketing spend and revenues generated by large events such as the European Championship football tournament and the Olympics in Paris. PwC predicts that advertising revenues will surpass $1tn in 2026, with a doubling of those recorded in 2020 expected by 2028.

Publicis' French market accounts for only 6% of sales but remains significant as its headquarters. Despite political and economic challenges facing France, the company has experienced growth over the past six months.
