空白支票公司资金激增，表明SPAC市场将反弹

**摘要：**
这篇文章讨论了特殊目的收购公司（SPAC）资金的复苏，它们也被称作空白支票公司，尽管之前有过丑闻和监管打击。根据Dealogic的数据，投资者和银行家正在筹集数十亿美元来支持新的SPAC IPO，与2023年同期相比增加了20%，达到31亿美元。

SPAC允许公司通过首次公开募股筹集资金，然后再寻找其他公司进行收购。自6月以来，超过20家SPAC已提交IPO文件，筹资目标为43亿美元，而2023年下半年的筹资额仅为18亿美元。

文章强调，尽管该行业需要努力取信于怀疑的企业和投资者，但SPAC有潜力填补主流IPO和战略并购退出所留下的空白。当前的市场条件有利于更多专业的重复发行人，他们瞄准了比前几年更少的投机性部门。

尽管乐观情绪增加，但一些SPAC创始人已采取措施减少风险，在早期的衰退中亏本，通过结构化交易来实现这一点，即外部投资者资助赞助商初始投资的大部分。这种做法颇具争议，但被认为对赞助商和IPO投资者之间达成一致是合理的。

文章最后希望SPAC最终能够被重新品牌化，使其更有吸引力，就像“垃圾”债券成为高收益债券或杠杆收购演变成私募股权一样。

 **Summary:**
The article discusses the resurgence in funding for special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs), also known as blank cheque companies, despite previous scandals and regulatory crackdowns. Investors and bankers are raising billions of dollars to support new Spac IPOs, with a 20% increase over the same period in 2023, reaching $3.1 billion according to Dealogic data.

Spacs allow companies to raise money through an initial public offering before searching for another company to acquire. More than 20 Spacs have filed IPO documents since June, targeting a combined fundraising of $4.3 billion compared to just $1.8 billion in the second half of 2023.

The article highlights that while the industry will need to work hard to win over skeptical companies and investors, there is potential for Spacs to fill a sizeable portion of the void left by mainstream IPOs and strategic M&A exits. The current market conditions favor more specialist repeat issuers targeting less speculative sectors than in previous years.

Despite increased optimism, some Spac founders have taken steps to reduce their risks after losing out during the earlier bust by structuring deals where outside investors fund a majority of the sponsor's initial investment. This practice has been controversial but is seen as reasonable for creating alignment between sponsors and IPO investors.

The article concludes with the hope that Spacs will eventually be rebranded to something more pleasing, similar to how "junk" bonds became high-yield bonds or leveraged buyouts evolved into private equity.
