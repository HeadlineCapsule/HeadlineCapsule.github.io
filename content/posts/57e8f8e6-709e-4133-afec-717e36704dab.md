内塔尼亚胡表示以色列军队将继续驻扎在埃及加沙边境。

**以色列将无限期控制埃及与加沙之间的边界**

以色列总理内塔尼亚胡坚持表示，以色列将无限期控制埃及与加沙之间的边界，这表明在谈判人员寻求达成协议以释放哈马斯扣押的人质时，以色列将长期保持军事存在。

以色列国防军今年5月控制了加沙与埃及边界的拉法边境口岸加沙一侧，并扩大了其控制范围，包括与埃及接壤的整个边界区域，称为“费城走廊”。

内塔尼亚胡是在开罗举行的谈判期间发表上述言论的，谈判目的是达成协议，释放哈马斯扣押的大约120名人质。根据该交易，以色列军队将分阶段从加沙撤军，并暂停战斗。

以色列已经建造了基础设施，将该地区分为两个独立的区域，检查站阻止巴勒斯坦平民和援助车队在加沙北部和南部之间通行。

拉法口岸的接管扰乱了人道主义援助供应，并防止受伤的巴勒斯坦人被疏散接受医疗护理。埃及谴责以色列控制边界，拒绝在以色列部队维持控制的情况下重新开放口岸。

文章还提到，以色列上一次控制该地区是在2005年，当时他们从加沙撤出了军队和犹太定居者。此后，加沙与埃及之间的边界成为繁荣的商业贸易路线。

 **Summary of Article:**

- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists that Israel will control the crossing between Egypt and Gaza indefinitely, signaling a long-term military presence as negotiators seek to reach an agreement for the release of hostages held by Hamas. 
- The Israeli Defense Forces took control of the Gazan side of the Rafah border crossing to Egypt in May and expanded their area of control to include the entire border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi corridor.
- Netanyahu's comments came during talks in Cairo aimed at reaching an agreement for releasing about 120 hostages held by Hamas. The deal would require a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a pause in fighting.
- Israel has built up infrastructure that divides the enclave into two separate zones, with checkpoints preventing Palestinian civilians and aid convoys from crossing between northern and southern Gaza. 
- The takeover of the Rafah crossing disrupted humanitarn aid supplies and prevented wounded Palestinians from being evacuated for medical care. Egypt condemned Israel's control over the border, refusing to reopen it as long as Israeli forces maintain control.
- The article also mentions that Israel last controlled the territory in 2005 when they withdrew troops and Jewish settlers from Gaza. Since then, the crossing between Gaza and Egypt had been a thriving commercial trade route.
