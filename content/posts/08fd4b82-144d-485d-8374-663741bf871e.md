唐纳德·特朗普与右翼“2025年项目”政策纲领保持距离

**唐纳德·特朗普与右翼“2525项目”保持距离**

前总统唐纳德·特朗普试图与一群有影响力的右翼政策专家保持距离，他们为这位前共和党总统提供了有争议的蓝图，如果他确保在白宫再任期四年。特朗普这一举动被视为试图在11月选举之前吸引温和选民的努力，在该选举中，他比乔·拜登拥有明显的民意调查优势。

这些右翼政策专家与**2525项目**有关，该项目是由遗产基金会智库制定的，旨在为未来的特朗普政府提供一个政策框架。**2525项目**的建筑师提出了彻底改革联邦政府和积极的社会保守主义提案，包括要求联邦政府削减对堕胎的任何资助，并要求食品药品监督管理局撤销对堕胎药的批准。

特朗普表示，他不同意**2525项目**的一些方面，并且声称不知道谁在幕后策划。他祝他们好运，但断言与他们没有任何关系。遗产基金会主席凯文·罗伯茨（Kevin Roberts）最近声称，美国正在经历“第二次美国革命”，如果左派允许，它将是无血的。

民主党人指责特朗普试图“绝望地掩盖他与**2525项目**的深厚联系”。**2525项目**发言人表示，他们不代表任何候选人或竞选活动，而是110多个保守派团体的联盟，为下一任保守派总统提供政策和人事建议。

总之，唐纳德·特朗普与右翼**2525项目**保持距离，该项目提出了有争议的政策，如果他确保再次担任总统。这一举动被视为试图在11月选举之前吸引温和选民的努力。

 **Donald Trump distances himself from right-wing 'Project 2525'**

Former President Donald Trump has sought to distance himself from a group of influential right-wing policy wonks who have offered a controversial blueprint for the former Republican president should he secure another four years in the White House. The move by Trump is seen as an effort to appeal to moderate voters ahead of November's election, where he enjoys a clear polling advantage over President Joe Biden.

The right-wing policy wonks are associated with **Project 2525**, drawn up by the Heritage Foundation think-tank, intended to provide a policy framework for a future Trump administration. The architects of Project 2525 have proposed a dramatic overhaul of the federal government and aggressive socially conservative proposals, including demanding that the federal government cut any funding for abortions and that the Food and Drug Administration reverse its approval of abortion pills.

Trump has stated he disagrees with some aspects of Project 2525 and claims to have no idea who is behind it. He wishes them luck but asserts having nothing to do with them. The Heritage Foundation's president, Kevin Roberts, recently claimed that the US was "in the process of the second American Revolution," which will remain bloodless if the left allows it.

Democrats have accused Trump of a "desperate attempt to hide his deep ties with Project 2525." A spokespader for Project 2525 stated that they do not speak for any candidate or campaign, and are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative president.

In summary, Donald Trump has distanced himself from right-wing 'Project 2525,' which proposes controversial policies should he secure another term as President. This move is seen as an attempt to appeal to moderate voters ahead of November's election.
