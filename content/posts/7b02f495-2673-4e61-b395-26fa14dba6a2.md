澳大利亚指责中国黑客入侵政府网络

# 澳大利亚指控中国黑客

澳大利亚政府指控一个名为 APT4e0（高级持续威胁 40）的中国国家赞助的网络团体，针对其网络和私营部门。这一指控得到了美国、英国、德国、日本、加拿大、新西兰和韩国等盟国的支持。

## 关键点：
- 该集团据称为中国国家安全部开展了“恶意网络行动”。
- APT40 据报已瞄准美国、加拿大、欧洲和中东的政府机构、公司和大学。
- 澳大利亚声称，APT4e0 利用微软和 Atlassian 开发的软件中的漏洞来入侵网络并窃取数据。

## 盟国的支持：
五眼伙伴国（美国、英国、加拿大、新西兰）以及德国、日本和韩国的安全和情报机构支持这一声明。这些国家对 APT40 对它们网络造成的威胁有着“共同的认识”。

## 历史性入侵：
澳大利亚信号局强调了 APT4e0 实施的两起历史性入侵事件，以说明其活动。该集团利用软件中的漏洞，在至少一个网络中建立了存在，窃取了数据和数百个密码。

## 澳大利亚的回应：
尽管最近努力与北京修补关系，但澳大利亚自 2022 年以来增加了对网络安全的投资，这是其更广泛的国防支出改革的一部分。这包括与亚马逊签订 13 亿美元的协议，以建立一个国防云网络，改善与全球盟友的情报共享能力。

## 结论：
澳大利亚当局对 APT4e0 的指控是前所未有的，反映了西方政府持续努力打击中国网络安全威胁、提高公众对黑客和间谍活动的风险意识以及保护其网络。

 **Australia accuses China-backed hackers**  
The Australian government has accused a Chinese state-sponsored cyber group, known as APT4e0 (Advanced Persistent Threat 40), of targeting its networks and those in the private sector. This accusation is supported by allies including the US, UK, Germany, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, and South Korea.

**Key Points:**  
- The group allegedly conducted "malicious cyber operations" for China's Ministry of State Security.
- APT40 has reportedly targeted government agencies, companies, and universities in the US, Canada, Europe, and the Middle East.
- Australia claims that APT4e0 exploited vulnerabilities in software developed by Microsoft and Atlassian to breach networks and steal data.

**Allies' Support:**  
The statement was backed by security and intelligence agencies from Five Eyes partner countries (US, UK, Canada, New Zealand) as well as Germany, Japan, and South Korea. These nations share a "shared understanding" of the threat posed to their networks by APT40.

**Historic Breaches:**  
The Australian Signals Directorate highlighted two historic breaches perpetrated by APT4e0 to illustrate its activities. The group exploited vulnerabilities in software and established a presence within at least one network, stealing data and hundreds of passwords.

**Australia's Response:**  
Despebite recent efforts to mend relations with Beijing, Australia has increased investment in cyber security since 2022 as part of its wider defense spending overhaul. This includes a $1.3 billion deal with Amazon to build a defense cloud network for improved intelligence sharing capabilities with global allies.

**Conclusion:**  
The accusation against APT4e0 is unprecedented for an Australian authority and reflects the ongoing efforts by western governments to crack down on Chinese cyber security threats, raise public awareness about risks of hacking and espionage, and protect their networks.
