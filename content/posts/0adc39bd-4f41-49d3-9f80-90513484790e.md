英国公司积极推动取消纸质股票

# 关键要点：
- 英国顶级公司，如 BP、Shell、BAE Systems 等，正推动完全数字化的股东登记册改革。
- 目前的系统涉及维护单独的纸质登记册和中央存管处 CREST，导致大量浪费性支出在物理证书和其他相关费用上。
- 道格拉斯·弗林特爵士（Sir Douglas Flint）的临时建议支持全面数字化；然而，人们担心他的最终报告可能提出一个不太全面的方法。
- 削弱改革可能会导致公司维护两个登记册（纸质和数字），从而增加成本，而不是简化流程。
- 游说团体，如 TheCityUK、英国金融业协会和欧洲金融市场协会参与讨论，以确保弗林特的最终报告与全面数字化的原始提案保持一致。
- 就这一问题进行长期辩论可能会对伦敦作为国际公司上市地点的声誉产生负面影响，同时也努力改革其股票市场规则。

 **Key Points:**
- Top UK companies like BP, Shell, BAE Systems, and others are pushing for fully digital shareholder registers as part of an overhaul effort.
- The current system involves maintaining separate paper-based registers alongside the central depository CREST, leading to significant wasteful spending on physical certificates and related expenses.
- Sir Douglas Flint's provisional recommendation supports full digitization; however, concerns have been raised that his final report may suggest a less comprehensive approach.
- A watered down reform could result in companies maintaining two registers (paper and digital), increasing costs instead of streamlining the process.
- Lobby groups such as TheCityUK, UK Finance, and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe are involved in discussions to ensure Flint's final report aligns with the original proposal for full digitization.
- A prolonged debate over this issue could negatively impact London's reputation as a listing venue for international companies amidst efforts to revamp its stock market rules.
