印尼采取措施减少中国对镍项目的所有权

# 印尼努力减少国内镍项目中的中国所有权

印度尼西亚政府正在努力减少中国对该国镍矿项目的所有权。这一举措与美国总统乔·拜登的《通货膨胀削减法案》（IRA）一致，该法案为使用电池和关键矿物但不在“令人担忧的外国实体”中（包括具有重大中国所有权的实体）生产的电动汽车提供税收优惠。

为了符合IRA的税收抵免规定，印度尼西亚正在重新构架新的镍矿投资交易，让中国公司成为少数股东。这一举措旨在实现行业多样化，减少地缘政治紧张局势，同时维护国家利益。然而，与美国的贸易协议谈判仍在进行中，由于中国公司在印度尼西亚镍业中的主导地位，该国符合资格仍然具有挑战性。

## 关键要点：
- 印度尼西亚努力减少中国在新矿山和镍加工项目中的所有权，旨在帮助其行业符合拜登总统IRA倡议的税收优惠规定，该倡议试图遏制北京在电动汽车供应链中的影响力。
- IRA从2025年开始提供税收抵免，但不会适用于包含电池和关键矿物且来自“令人担忧的外国实体”的电动汽车，包括具有重大中国所有权的实体。
- 印度尼西亚政府和行业正在努力与**中国公司作为少数股东**的新镍矿投资交易，这可能使产量符合IRA税收抵免的资格。然而，与美国的贸易协议也是符合资格的必要条件。
- 韩国和日本等潜在客户向印度尼西亚施加压力，要求其遵守IRA，这可能会影响印度尼西亚与中国公司关于镍项目所有权股份的谈判。
- 由于中国拥有的公司占印度尼西亚电池级镍产量和行业的大片市场份额，减少中国影响力的努力将面临挑战。

 **Summary:**  
The Indonesian government is working to reduce Chinese ownership of nickel projects within its borders. This initiative aligns with President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers tax breaks for electric vehicles (EVs) that use batteries and critical minerebut not sourced from "foreign entities of concern," including those with significant Chinese ownership.

To qualify for these IRA tax credits, Indonesia is restructuring new nickel investment deals to involve Chinese companies as minority shareholders. This move aims to diversify the industry and reduce geopolitical tensions while maintaining national interests. However, negotiations with potential US trade agreements are still ongoing, and it remains challenging for Indonesia to qualify due to the dominant presence of Chinese companies in its nickel industry.

**Key Points:**  
- **Indonesia's efforts** to reduce Chinese ownership in new nickel mining and processing projects aim to help its industry qualify for tax breaks under President Joe Biden’s IRA initiative, which seeks to curb Beijing's influence in the EV supply chain.  
- **Tax credits from 2025** are available under the IRA but will not apply to EVs containing batteries and critical minerals sourced from "foreign entities of concern," including those with significant Chinese ownership.  
- Indonesia's government and industry are working on new nickel investment deals involving **Chinese companies as minority shareholders**, potentially allowing the output to attract IRA tax credits. However, a trade agreement with the US is also necessary for qualification.  
- The country faces pressure from potential customers in South Korea and Japan to comply with the IRA, which could impact its negotiations with Chinese companies regarding ownership stakes in nickel projects.  
- **Reducing China's influence** will be a challenge due to the significant presence of Chinese-owned producers within Indonesia's battery-grade nickel output and industry.
