微软招聘Inflection AI员工被英国监管机构调查

**英国监管机构调查微软招聘Inflection AIR员工事宜**

微软从AI初创公司Inflection招聘员工一事已受到英国竞争和市场管理局（CMA）的正式调查。 CMA启动了对微软收购“某些前Inflection AI员工”的正式调查，这是其对快速发展的**人工智能行业**并购案更广泛担忧的一部分。

监管机构曾邀请各方于今年4月就微软和Inflection的合作发表评论，并担心此类合作可能不符合英国合并规则。 将此调查提升到下一级别的截止日期定为9月11日。

微软对自己的招聘做法充满信心，称其促进了竞争，并断言Inflection的交易不应被视为合并。 微软去年参与了Inflection价值13亿美元的融资轮，并支付6.5亿美元从Inflection AI收购了关键人员，包括Google DeepMind的联合创始人Mustafa Suleyman。

Inflection最初于2022年创立是一家消费者AI公司，但在大多数员工加入微软后，该公司转向向企业销售企业AI软件。 这一举动引起了监管机构和法律专家的关注，他们认为这类似于微软的收购，但不受正式合并规则的约束。

CMA对微软-Inflection交易的调查是更广泛趋势的一部分，即大科技公司的人工智能交易在美国、欧盟和英国受到监管机构的严格审查。 其他值得注意的例子包括：随着全球关注科技巨头如苹果、亚马逊和谷歌对AI初创公司的投资不断增长，微软退出OpenAI董事会观察员职位。

 **UK Regulator Probes Microsoft's Hiring of Inflection AIR Staff**
Microsoft's hiring of staff from AI startup Inflection has been officially investigated by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA launched a formal inquiry into Microsoft's acquisition of "certain former employees of Inflection AI" as part of its broader concerns about dealmaking in the fast-developing **AI industry**.

The regulator had invited comments on the tie-up between Microsoft and Inflection last April, citing worries that such partnerships may not fall within UK merger rules. The deadline for escalating this probe to the next level is set for September 11.

Microsoft maintains confidence in its hiring practices, stating it promotes competition and asserts that the Inflection deal should not be treated as a merger. Microsoft had participated in a $1.3 billion funding round for Inflection last year and paid $650 million to acquire key personnel from Inflection AI, including its CEO Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Google's DeepMind.

Inflection was initially founded as a consumer AI company in 2022 but pivoted towards selling enterprise AI software to businesses after most staff joined Microsoft post the hiring deal. This move has drawn scrutiny from regulators and legal experts, who argue that it resembles an acquisition by Microsoft without being subjected to formal merger rules.

The CMA's investigation into Microsoft-Inflection is part of a broader trend where Big Tech AI deals are under the watchful eye of regulators in the US, EU, and UK. Other notable examples include Microsoft stepping down as an observer on OpenAI's board amidst growing global attention to investments in AI startups by tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Google.
