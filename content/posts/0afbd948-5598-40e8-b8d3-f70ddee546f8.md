西岩纸业目标美国上市推高股价

**西岩纸业** 是一家总部位于都柏林的新型包装集团，最近将其主要股票上市从伦敦转移到纽约，旨在推动股价和估值上涨。该公司的首席执行官托尼·斯米尔菲特（Tony Smurfit）相信，如果这能带来反映其表现的股价上涨，那么这一举措将是成功的。

爱尔兰的**斯米尔菲特卡帕**与总部位于美国的西岩公司合并，形成了年销售额200亿美元的包装巨头。西岩纸业在纽约证券交易所（NYSE）上市时每股47.40美元，预计此次合并将节省4亿美元成本。

根据经纪公司戴维（Davy）的包装分析师贾斯汀·乔丹（Justin Jordan）的说法，与美国的国际纸业和美洲包装公司相比，西岩纸业目前的估值折让率超过20%。然而，随着对合并整合的信心增强，他预计该公司股价将得到积极的重新评估。

去年，包装行业经历了低谷，但现在需求和价格都在上涨，显示出复苏迹象。西岩纸业对此做出了反应，将其箱子价格提高了30% 到35%。首席执行官预计未来几年价格将继续上涨，这将改善盈利能力。

该公司将主要上市地点转移到纽约，这符合欧洲公司寻求在美国市场获得更高估值的趋势。由于这一转变，西岩纸业预计将至少有25%到30%的时间花在美国。此次合并已经带来了约4亿美元的效率节约，该公司计划明智地投资并最大化资产价值。

总之，西岩纸业从伦敦搬到纽约是为了提高股价和估值，利用更大的资本池。与西岩公司的合并已经带来了显著的成本节约，该公司预计在根据市场需求调整箱子价格后，盈利能力将进一步增长。

 **Smurfit Westrock**, a newly merged packaging group based in Dublin, has recently shifted its primary stock listing from London to New York with the aim of boosting share price and valuation. The company's CEO, Tony Smurfit, beltieves that this move will be successful if it results in an increased share price reflective of their performance.

The merger between Ireland's **Smurfit Kappa** and US-based WestRock has led to the creation of a packaging giant with sales worth $20 billion. Smurfit Westrock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $47.40 per share, targeting cost savings of $400 million from this merger.

According to Justin Jordan, a packaging analyst at brokerage Davy, Smurfit Westrock currently trades at over 20% valuation discount compared to its US peers International Paper and Packaging Corporation of America. However, as confidence in the merger integration builds, he expects a positive re-rating for the company's share price.

The packaging industry experienced a "trough" last year but is now showing signs of recovery with increasing demand and rising prices. Smurfit Westrock has responded to this by raising its own box prices by 30% to 35%. The CEO anticipates further increases in the coming years, which will improve profitability.

The company's primary listing move to New York follows a trend of European companies seeking higher valuations in the US market. Smurfit Westrock is expected to spend at least 25% to 30% of its time in America due to this shift. The merger has already resulted in an estimated $400 million in efficiency savings, and the company plans to continue investing wisely while maximizing asset value.

In summary, Smurfit Westrock's move from London to New York aims to boost its share price and valuation by tapping into larger capital pools. The merger with WestRock has already led to significant cost savings, and the company expects further growth in profitability as it adjusts box prices according to market demand.
