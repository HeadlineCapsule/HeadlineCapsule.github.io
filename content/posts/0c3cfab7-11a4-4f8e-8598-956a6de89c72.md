在伦敦，AIM上市的公司数量降至22年来的最低水平

**伦敦小型股市上市企业数量下降**

由于多种因素的综合作用，在替代投资市场（Aim）上市的小型公司数量达到22年来的最低点。这些因素包括：

1. 初次公开募股（IPO）显著减少，根据UHY Hacker Young会计师事务所的数据，今年1月至6月只有8家公司上市。
2. 越来越多的公司退出市场，在过去的一年里，大约有80家公司离开了Aim。这使Aim上的总公司数量减少到：

**伦敦小型股市上市企业数量下降**

伦敦的替代投资市场（Aim）正在经历严重的衰退，上市的小型公司数量降至20多年来的最低点。这种下滑趋势可归因于：

1. 初次公开募股（IPO）急剧减少，根据UHY Hacker Young会计师事务所的数据，今年1月至6月只有8家公司上市。
2. 越来越多的公司选择退市，仅在过去的一年里就有约80家公司离开Aim市场。这将Aim上的总公司数量降至722家。

上市公司数量下降也部分归因于大型公司选择纽约或其他欧洲市场而不是伦敦，因为它们寻求更高的估值和接触更广泛的投资者基础的机会。此外，小型公司面临着在Aim上市的成本负担比其规模更重的挑战，同时实现最佳估值。

Aim的建立是为了帮助小型、快速增长的公司通过比伦敦证券交易所主板市场更灵活的上市规则来获得资本。然而，一些公司选择退市，因为与在Aim上市的高成本和繁琐要求。

引述公司联盟（Quoted Companies Alliance）指出，在Aim上市大约需要60万英镑，而保持上市状态每年会产生约50万英镑的额外费用。一些公司选择退出，转向近年来发展壮大的私募市场。

尽管面临这些挑战，Aim仍然是全球领先的增长型市场，也是欧洲最活跃的市场。在近30年的历史中，它支持了超过4000家公司筹集了近1350亿英镑的股权资本，促进了创新、就业增长和经济发展。

 **Decline of Small Companies on London's Junior Stock Market**  
The number of small companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) has reached a 22-year low due to a combination of factors. These include:

1. A significant decrease in initial public offerings (IPOs), with only eight IPOs recorded from January to June, according to UHY Hacker Young accountancy group.  
2. An increasing number of companies delisting from the market, as approximately 80 have left within the past year. This has reduced the total count on Aim to abbreviated version:

**Decline in Small Companies Listed on London's Junior Stock Market**  
The Alternative Investment Market (Aim) in London is experiencing a significant decline, with the number of small companies listed reaching its lowest point in over two decades. This downturn can be attributed to:

1. A sharp decrease in initial public offerings (IPOs), with only eight IPOs occurring from January to June as reported by UHY Hacker Young accountancy group.  
2. An increasing number of companies delisting, with around 80 having left the market within the past year alone. This has reduced the total count on Aim to a mere 722.

The decline in listings is also partly due to larger companies opting for New York or other European markets over London, seeking higher valuations and access to a broader investor base. Additionally, smaller companies face challenges in achieving optimal valuation while bearing the heavier costs of being listed on Aim compared to their size.

Aim was established with the goal of assisting small, fast-growing companies in accessing capital through less stringent listing rules than those required by the London Stock Exchange's main market. However, some companies have chosen to delist due to high costs and burdensome requirements associated with maintaining a listing on Aim.

The Quoted Companies Alliance highlighted that floating on Aim can cost around £600,000, while keeping the listing incurs an additional annual expense of approximately £50nk. Some companies have opted to delist in favor of private markets, which have seen significant growth in recent years.

Despite these challenges, Aim remains a pre-eminent global growth market and the most active in Europe. Over its nearly 30-year history, it has supported more than 4,000 companies to raise almost £135bn in equity capital, enabling innovation, job creation, and economic growth.
