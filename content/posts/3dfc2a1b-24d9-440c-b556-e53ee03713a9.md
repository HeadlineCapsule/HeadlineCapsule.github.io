影院连锁公司 Cineworld 考虑关闭其英国四分之一的影院

**Cineworld** 考虑关闭英国四分之一的电影院作为重组计划的一部分

- Cineworld 在英国经营着超过 100 家电影院，正在考虑关闭这些场所中的四分之一。这一决定是公司为削减成本而实施的广泛**重组交易**的一部分。这家影院运营商在 2021 年被伦敦证券交易所除牌后面临财务困难，随后被其贷款人接管。

- 除了关闭一些电影院外，Cineworld 还计划就大约 50 家其他场所与房东重新谈判租赁协议。该公司打算在未来几周内向债权人提出这一提议。这种重组计划是一种于 2020 年引入的新流程，需要法院批准，而不是**公司自愿安排**（CVA）。

- AlixPartners 被任命为 Cineworld 重组过程的顾问，而该公司本身对进一步细节三缄其口。由于大流行持续影响以及好莱坞演员和编剧最近罢工导致电影制作在 2023 年停止，电影行业继续面临挑战。

拟议中的关闭电影院是 Cineworld 努力解决财务压力的部分内容，这些压力因 88 亿美元的债务和租赁负债而加剧，此前发生了一系列收购。该公司于 2022 年在美国申请了第 11 章破产保护，但在投资者将数十亿美元的债务转换为股权后脱困。

电影行业整体受到有限的电影供应影响，Cineworld 的竞争对手 Vue 在其年度报告中警告说，罢工对该部门的影响将持续很长时间。由于可用于剧院发行的电影数量较少，预计 2024 年及以后效果最为显著。

 **Cineworld** considers closing quarter of its UK cinemas as part of restructuring plan

- Cineworld, which operates over 100 cinemas across the UK, is contemplating shutting down up to a quarter of these venues. This decision forms part of an extensive **restructuring deal** aimed at reducing costs within the company. The cinema operator faced financial difficulties after being delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2021 and subsequently taken over by its lenders.

- In addition to closing some cinemas, Cineworld plans to renegotiate rental agreements with landlords for approximately 50 other venues. The company intends to present this proposal to creditors within the coming weeks. This restructuring plan is a new process introduced in 2020 and requires court approval rather than being a **company voluntary arrangement** (CVA).

- AlixPartners has been appointed as an adviser for Cineworld's restructuring process, while the company itself remains tight-lipped about further details. The cinema industry continues to face challenges due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic and a recent joint strike by Hollywood actors and screenwriters that halted film production in 2023.

The proposed closure of cinemas is part of Cineworld's efforts to address its financial stress, which has been exacerbated by an $8.8 billion debt and lease liability following a series of acquisitions. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in 2022 but emerged from the proceedings after investors converted multibillion-pounds' worth of debt into equity.

The cinema industry as a whole has been affected by limited film supply, with Cineworld's competitor Vue warning about the long-lasting impact of the strikes on the sector in its annual report. The effects are expected to be most significant in 2024 and beyond due to fewer completed films being available for theatrical release.
