特朗普“封口费”案量刑推迟至9月

# 摘要：

唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）因曼哈顿“封口费”案而被判刑，但宣判日期从7月11日推迟至9月18日，此前美国最高法院就总统免予起诉的特权做出裁决。前领导人于5月被定罪为34项重罪，最初预计将在7月11日被判刑。特朗普的律师在最高法院裁定总统享有广泛特权后请求延缓宣判，认为审判中使用的某些证据可能属于“官方行为”，因此根据这一决定不应被采纳。

尽管曼哈顿地区检察官办公室认为特朗普的论点毫无根据，但并没有反对推迟请求。这次推迟为特朗普提供了另一个法律喘息空间，可能会加强他在11月总统大选前四个月的政治地位。最高法院裁定，前任总统仍会因其在职期间的私人行为而受到刑事起诉。然而，其他三起针对特朗普的待审刑事案件不太可能在选举日之前进行审判。

由于人们担心乔·拜登（Joe Biden）的年龄和任职资格，以及他上周糟糕的辩论表现，特朗普越来越被视为11月大选的领先者。根据FiveThirtyEight的平均值，特朗普全国领先1.4个百分点，并在多个摇摆州领先。

 **Article Summary:**  
Donald Trump's sentencing hearing for the Manhattan "hush money" case has been postponed to September 18, following a US Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity from prosecution. The former leader was convicted of 34 felony counts in May and originally set to be sentenced on July 11. Trump's lawyers requested more time for appeal after the high court ruled that presidents have broad immunity, arguing some evidence used at trial might have been "official acts" and thus inadmissible under this decision.

The Manhattan district attorney's office did not oppose the delay request despite viewing Trump's arguments as without merit. This postponement is another legal respite for Trump, potentially strengthening his political position with four months to go until November's presidential election. The Supreme Court decision held that former presidents would still be subject to criminal prosecution for their private acts while in office. However, it seems unlikely any of the other three pending criminal cases against Trump will reach trial before election day.

Trump is increasingly seen as a frontrunner heading into November due to concerns about President Joe Biden's age and fitness for office following a disastrous debate performance last week. As per FiveThirtyEight average, Trump has a 1.4 point lead nationwide and leads in several swing states.
