唐纳德·图斯克与安杰伊·杜达在政策上争执不下，波兰大使陷入困境

# 波兰总统杜达与总理图斯克之间的争端导致外交人员大调整

波兰总统安杰伊·杜达（Andrzej Duda）和总理唐纳德·图斯克（Donald Tusk）之间的持续争端导致了波兰外交机构的重大调整，50名大使被替换，以反映图斯克联盟政府更自由、亲欧盟的观点。然而，来自右翼法律与正义党（PiS）的杜达利用总统权力阻挡了这些任命，因为存在政治分歧。

因此，提名人正在以充当使团团长或代理代表等较低级别开始他们的工作，而不是永久大使。这种情况正在波兰外交部门造成混乱，并引发了对国际关系影响的担忧。杜达还否决了图斯克的一些立法，包括旨在恢复司法独立以换取欧盟资金的措施。

两位领导人的争端超出了国内政治，对波兰与其他国家的关系及其在北约中的角色产生了影响。由于图斯克联盟政府去年推翻了PiS，政府和政策发生了戏剧性的变化，因此这种情况被认为是异常的。

 **Summary:**  
The ongoing tussle between Polish President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk has resulted in a significant reshuffling of Poland's diplomatic corps, with 50 ambassadors being replaced to reflect the more liberal and pro-EU views of Tusk’s coalition government. However, Duda, from the rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), has used his presidential powers to block these appointments due to political disagreements.

As a result, nominees are starting their jobs with lower ranks such as chargé d'affaires or acting representatives instead of permanent ambassadors. This situation is causing confusion within Poland’s foreign service and has led to concerns about the impact on international relations. Duda has also vetoed some of Tusk’s legislation, including measures aimed at restoring judicial independence in exchange for EU funding.

The dispute between the two leaders extends beyond domestic politics, with implications for Poland's relationships with other countries and its role within NATO. The situation is considered exceptional due to the dramatic change of government and policy since Tusk’s coalition ousted PiS last year.
