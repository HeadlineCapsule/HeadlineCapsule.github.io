德拉吉的Altice以英国电信股份作抵押获得超过10亿英镑的保证金贷款

# 亿万富翁帕特里克·德拉希（Patrick Drahi）领导的阿尔蒂斯（Altice）利用其持有的英国电信公司（BT）24.5%的股份作为抵押，从边际贷款中筹集了超过10亿英镑。这种借贷策略引起了人们的关注，即在阿尔蒂斯面临广泛财务挑战和债务不断增加的情况下，维持这一立场的长期可持续性。

阿尔蒂斯英国最初利用衍生品和银行贷款在2021年建立了英国电信公司18%的股份。 2022年1月，他们与多家大型银行以及德意志银行签署了新的边际贷款协议，以英国电信公司的股份作为抵押，最多可借款15亿英镑。阿尔蒂斯后来于2023年5月利用进一步的股本期权融资将股份提高到了近25%，并已偿还了部分边际贷款。

尽管债务市场面临压力，但银行对英国电信公司高流动性股票价值的暴露并不过度担心。德拉希拥有大多数阿尔蒂斯股份，但之前曾与共同创始人阿曼多·佩雷拉（Armando Pereira）分享利润，后者去年因腐败调查而被捕。

自贷款获得以来，英国电信公司的股价下跌了近25%，尽管在新首席执行官艾丽森·柯克比（Allison Kirkby）宣布了该公司的转型计划后，股价上涨。墨西哥亿万富翁卡洛斯·斯利姆（Carlos Slim）最近也收购了英国电信公司3%的股份。阿尔蒂斯英国表示，他们目前没有收购的计划，但如果另一方宣布出价，他们将重新考虑。

**要点：**
- 阿尔蒂斯利用其持有的英国电信公司24.5%的股份作为抵押，从边际贷款中筹集了超过10亿英镑
- 借贷策略引起了人们的关注，即在阿尔蒂斯面临广泛财务挑战和债务不断增加的情况下，维持这一立场的长期可持续性
- 利用大型银行提供的资金股本期权来建立其股份，这使他们能够在借款大量资金的同时对潜在的股价下跌进行对冲
- 尽管债务市场面临压力，但银行对英国电信公司高流动性股票价值的暴露并不过度担心
- 德拉希拥有大多数阿尔蒂斯股份，但之前曾与共同创始人阿曼多·佩雷拉分享利润，后者因腐败调查而被捕

 **Summary:**  
Altice, led by billionaire Patrick Drahi, raised over £1bn in margin loans against its 24.5% stake in BT. This borrowing strategy raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of maintaining this position amidst Altice's wider financial challenges and increasing debts. The company utilized funded equity collars from major banks to build up their stake, which allowed them to hedge against potential share price falls while borrowing heavily.

Altice UK initially built a 18% stake in BT using derivatives and bank loans in 2amoeba_culture_2021. In January 2022, they signed a new margin loan facility with the same banks plus Deutsche Bank to borrow up to £1.5bn against BT shares. Altice later increased its stake to almost 25% using further collar financing in May 2023 and has since repaid part of the margin loan.

Despite pressure on debt markets, banks are not overly concerned about their exposure due to BT's large and liquid stock value. Drahi owns most Altice shares but had previously shared profits with co-founder Armando Pereira, who was arrested in a corruption probe last year.

BT's share price has fallen nearly 25% since the loan was taken out, although it rallied after new CEO Allison Kirkby announced her turnaround plans for the company. Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim also recently acquired a 3% stake in BT. Altice UK stated that they have no current plans to make a bid but would reconsider if another party announces an offer.
