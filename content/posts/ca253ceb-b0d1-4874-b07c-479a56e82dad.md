拜登誓言要“完成工作”，尽管在新闻发布会上出现失误

**美国总统乔·拜登周四举行的新闻发布会解决了人们对他的精神敏锐性的担忧，他承认自己需要更好地调整步伐并多睡觉。他还提到进行了三次重要的神经学检查，结果良好。尽管有这些承认，拜登强调，在评估他担任总统的合适性时，应该关注他的成就记录。**

在新闻发布会上，拜登讨论了他的时间表调整，并与前总统特朗普在同一时期的活动进行了比较。他还提到在他的总统任期内创造了强劲的就业数字，这是他表现得好的一个方面。

预测性交易员评级为拜登的连任竞选取得了一定成功，他在PredictIt上的隐含概率上升到44％，与卡玛拉·哈里斯的概率相同。然而，一些民主党人对拜登的候选人资格仍然存在担忧，这在最近几天导致了该党派分裂。

为了回应这些担忧，众议院议长南希·佩洛西敦促民主党领导人不要在外国领导人访问华盛顿参加北约峰会时破坏拜登。尽管如此，拜登承认他需要消除民主党人对他的候选人资格的恐惧，并坚持认为没有人告诉他不能在即将到来的选举中击败特朗普。

自6月27日辩论以来，民意调查数据显示特朗普在拜登面前打开了更广泛的领先优势，因此民主党领导人哈基姆·杰弗里斯一直与众议院成员接触，讨论他们的担忧并为该党制定前进的道路。

 The news conference held by President Joe Biden on Thursday addressed concerns about his mental acuity, with him acknowledging that he needs to pace himself better and get more sleep. He also mentioned taking three significant neurological exams which showed good results. Despite these admissions, Biden emphasized that his record of accomplishments should be the focus when evaluating his fitness for office.

During the press conference, Biden discussed his schedule adjustments and compared it to former President Trump's activities during the same period. He also mentioned strong job creation numbers under his presidency as a point in favor of his performance.

Predictive traders rated the news conference as a modest success for Biden's re-election campaign, with his implied odds on PredictIt rising to 44 percent, tied with those of Kamala Harris. However, concerns about Biden's candidacy persist among some Democrats and have led to defections from the party in recent days.

In response to these concerns, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had urged Democratic leaders not to undermine Biden while foreign leaders were visiting Washington for a Nato summit. Despite this, Biden acknowledged that he needed to allay fears about his candidacy among Democrats and insisted that no one was telling him he could not beat Trump in the upcoming election.

As polling data since the debate on June 27 has shown Trump opening up a wider lead over Biden, Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries have been engaging with House members to discuss their concerns and plan a path forward for the party.
