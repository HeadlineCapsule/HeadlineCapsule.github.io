欧洲人利用北约峰会与特朗普的附属机构建立联系

# 文章摘要：
参加华盛顿北约峰会的欧洲代表团正在与唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的盟友接触，因为他们担心乔·拜登（Joe Biden）连任的前景。这些会议涉及来自各个欧洲政府的领导人与官员，旨在为潜在的特朗普未来政府做准备。这发生在拜登上个月辩论表现之后民意调查数字下降之际。

# 要点：

1. 参加北约峰会的**欧洲代表团**正在与唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）的盟友如基思·凯洛格（Keith Kellogg）和迈克·蓬佩奥（Mike Pompeo）会面，反映了人们对乔·拜登（Joe Biden）连任机会的担忧。

2. 会议旨在为潜在的特朗普未来政府建立联系，鉴于他之前在2016年令人惊讶的选举胜利。

3. 唐纳德·特朗普批评了北约，并对如果他连任美国对盟友的防务承诺表示怀疑。他还建议除非与莫斯科启动和平谈判，否则暂停对乌克兰的军事援助。

4. 欧洲国家已经向乌克兰提供了超过美国的资金支持，但特朗普要求他们将贡献“平等”到1000亿欧元。

5. 北约峰会的重点从在拜登领导下的统一西方联盟的展示转向了解决人们对拜登连任机会及其对欧洲安全的潜在影响的担忧。
