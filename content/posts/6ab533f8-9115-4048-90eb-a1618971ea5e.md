波音宣布47亿美元交易后，斯伦贝谢贝尔法斯特部门陷入困境

# 波音公司47亿美元收购精神航空航天系统公司的交易，让这家在北爱尔兰运营六家工厂的公司陷入了不确定性。政治家和工会领袖们担心潜在的拆解或将业务转移到其他地方，从而危及就业和增值研究与开发活动。

精神公司的贝尔法斯特设施为空客A220飞机生产机翼和机身，以及为庞巴迪商务飞机、罗尔斯-罗伊斯和本田飞机公司生产零部件。然而，这些业务没有被纳入与波音的交易中，目前还没有买家。精神计划将其非空客业务，包括其在苏格兰和马来西亚的支持空客项目的工厂一起出售。

GMB工会警告说，如果业务被分割或转移到其他地方，将出现实际问题，使60%的工人陷入困境，他们不参与空客生产。北爱尔兰的航空航天行业雇佣了超过1万人，每年产生19亿英镑的收入。

空客已同意接管精神公司在美国、法国、摩洛哥和贝尔法斯特的四家工厂的A220和A350项目的生产。然而，空客将不会在做出最终决定之前就如何管理这些工作包做出运营决策，这可能需要数月时间。

对于精神公司的非空客业务，一个可能的解决方案可能是让庞巴迪成为新的所有者，接管空客没有收购的部分业务以及未来的A220机身工作。英国政府和北爱尔兰行政机构致力于与精神合作，寻找潜在买家，确保高技能就业机会得到保护。

波音将从精神公司获得5.59亿美元的赔偿，并象征性地支付1美元购买这些资产。如果精神无法为其在Prestwick的非空客业务找到第三方买家，空客将收购这些业务。

 **Article Summary:**

Boeing's $4.7 billion acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems has left the company, which operates six plants in Northern Ireland, in a state of uncertainty. Politicians and union leaders have expressed concerns about potential dismantling or transferring operations elsewhere, risking job losses and value-added research and development activities.

Spirit's Belfast facilities produce wings and fuselages for Airbus A220 jets, as well as components for Bombardier’s business jets, Rolls-Royce, and Honda Aircraft. However, these operations are not included in the deal with Boeing and have no immediate buyer. Spirit plans to sell these non-Airbus operations along with its plants in Scotland and Malaysia that support Airbus programs.

The GMB union warns of practical problems if the business is split up or transferred elsewhere, leaving 60% of workers not involved in Airbus production in limbo. Northern Ireland's aerospace sector employs over 10,000 people and generates £1.9 billion in revenue annually.

Airbus has agreed to take over Spirit’s production for its A220 and A350 programs at four plants in the US, France, Morocco, and Belfast. However, Airbus will not make operational decisions regarding how it manages these work packages until a final decision is made, which could take months.

A possible solution for Spirit's non-Airbus operations may involve Bombardier as the new owner of the parts of the business that Airbus was not taking and any future A220 fuselage work. The UK government and Northern Ireland executive are committed to working with Spirit to identify potential buyers, ensuring skilled jobs are protected.

Boeing will receive $559 million in compensation from Spirit and pay a symbolic $1 for the assets. If Spirit fails to find a third-party buyer for its non-Airbus operations at Prestwick, Airbus would acquire them.
