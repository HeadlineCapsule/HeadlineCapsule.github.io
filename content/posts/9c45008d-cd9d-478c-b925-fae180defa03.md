罗氏将加速减肥药上市以抗衡竞争对手

# 罗氏加速研发抗肥胖药物

瑞士制药公司罗氏计划加速其抗肥胖药物的研发，以与礼来公司和诺和诺德等竞争对手展开竞争。这一举措是在公布了减肥药的积极数据之后做出的，这可能意味着第一种肥胖症药物将在 2028 年之前上市。

**要点：**

1. 罗氏去年以高达 31 亿美元的价格收购了生物技术公司卡摩特（Carmot），其中包括一种减肥针剂和药片，在对照安慰剂后四周内显示出 6.1% 的体重减少。
2. 该公司的首席执行官托马斯·希内克（Thomas Schinecker）表示，罗氏可能从卡摩特收购中获得大约七种药物，尽管到目前为止只披露了三种资产。
3. 罗氏药片的数据导致该公司股票上涨 6%，人们担心这将挑战诺和诺德和礼来公司在该领域的统治地位。
4. 预计肥胖市场到 2030 年将超过 1300 亿美元，多家公司正寻求推出自己的药物。
5. 罗氏需要赶上诺和诺德和礼来的步伐，这两家公司已经开发了更有效的治疗方法，如诺和诺德的 Wegovy 和礼来公司的 Mounjaro，分别导致体重减少约 15% 和咖啡杯。
6. 其他制药公司，如勃林格殷格翰、辉瑞和维京疗法也希望推出抗肥胖药物。
7. 罗氏药片是合成生产的，这可能使其比诺和诺德的肽基减肥药更易于大规模生产。
8. 巴克莱银行的分析师埃米莉·菲尔德（Emily Field）表示，现在判断罗氏是否能打乱诺和诺德和礼来领先的步伐为时过早。
9. 希内克于 2023 年 3 月接任首席执行官一职，重点是开发抗肥胖症和阿尔茨海默氏症的药物，同时削减表现不佳的药物 25%。
10. 罗氏希望其抗肥胖药物可与其他治疗方法结合使用，如 Vabysmo（眼部治疗）以解决与肥胖相关的疾病。

 **Roche's Fast-Tracking Anti-Obesity Drugs**  

Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche plans to fast-track its anti-obesity drugs in an effort to compete with rivals Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The move comes after promising data for a weight-loss pill was unveiled, potentially bringing the first obesity drugs to market by 2028.

**Key Points:**  

1. Roche acquired biotech Carmot in an up to $3.1 billion takeover last year, which includes a weight-loss jab and pill that showed a 6.1% reduction in weight compared with placebo after four weeks.
2. The company's chief executive, Thomas Schinecker, stated Roche could have around seven drugs from the Carmot acquisition, although only three assets have been disclosed so far.
3. Data on Roche's pill led to a 6% increase in shares for the Swiss company and concerns about challenging Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly's dominance in the sector.
4. The obesity market is expected to surpass $130 billion by 2030, with several companies seeking to launch their own drugs.
5. Roche will need to catch up with incumbents Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which have developed more effective treatments like Wegovy (Novo Nordisk) and Mounjaro (Eli Lilly), leading to about 15% and cups of coffee reduction in weight respectively.
6. Other drugmakers such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, and Viking Therapeutics are also hoping to launch obesity drugs.
7. Roche's pill is made synthetically, which may make it more scalable compared to Novo Nordisk's peptide-based weight-loss pill.
8. Analyst Emily Field from Barclays stated that it was too early to tell if Roche could disrupt the head start of Novo and Lilly.
9. Schinecker took over as CEO in March 2023, with a focus on developing promising drugs for obesity and Alzheimer's while cutting underperforming ones by 25%.
10. Roche hopes its obesity drugs can be used in combination with other treatments like Vabysmo (eye treatment) to address conditions linked to obesity.
