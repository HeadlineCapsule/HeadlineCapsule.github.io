台湾加强民防以应对来自中国的威胁

# 台湾加强民防建设应对中国威胁

- 面对中国日益增长的侵略行为，台湾正在加强民防措施。中国声称台湾是中国领土的一部分。
- 政府计划包括增加食品和能源储备、提高医院容量、加强通信基础设施，以及扩大民防人力。
- 蔡英文总统将于周四批准这些提案，继续其前任蔡英文的工作，即提高台湾在潜在的中国冲突中的韧性。
- 提案包括指定学校礼堂作为避难所，并通过便利店实施食品配给制度。政府还正在探索低地球轨道卫星服务，用于战时通信目的。
- 一个重大挑战是改革官僚结构，以确保不同部门（民用和军用）以及中央和地方政府之间的协调。

 **Taiwan's Civil Defence Strengthening Amid China Threat**

- Taiwan is enhancing its civil defence measures in response to increasing aggression from China, which claims the region as part of its territory. 
- The government plans include boosting food and energy stockpiles, raising hospital capacity, strengthening communication infrastructure, and expanding manpower for civil defence.
- President Lai Ching-te is set to approve these proposals on Thursday, continuing the work of his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in improving Taiwan's resilience against potential conflict with China.
- Proposals include designating school halls as shelters and implementing a food rationing system through convenience stores. The government is also exploring low Earth orbit satellite services for communication purposes during wartime.
- A significant challenge lies in overhauling bureaucratic structures to ensure coordination between different departments, both civilian and military, as well as central and local governments.
