美国指控做空者安德鲁·莱夫特（Andrew Left）欺诈

# 美国指控做空者安德鲁·莱夫特欺诈

司法部（DoJ）指控知名做空者安德鲁·莱夫特（Andrew Left）犯有十多项欺诈罪。指控称，他通过“长期市场操纵计划”获利至少1亿美元。洛杉矶联邦大陪审团以17项证券欺诈罪、1项从事证券欺诈计划罪和1项向联邦调查人员作虚假陈述罪起诉了他。

## 对安德鲁·莱夫特的指控：市场操纵和虚假陈述

根据司法部称，莱夫特利用其影响股票价格的能力，在社交媒体上针对零售投资者青睐的热门股票。他发布操纵市场的推荐，为自己赚取了利润。起诉书声称，他公开声称公司股票价格过高或过低，经常提供推荐的目标价格，并暗示Citron Research的交易立场。这给人留下了莱夫特经济激励与他的公共推荐一致的假象。

## 证券欺诈指控及潜在处罚：可能面临数十年监禁

如果被定罪，安德鲁·莱夫特可能面临数十年监禁。每项证券欺诈罪名最高可判处20年监禁，而证券欺诈计划和虚假陈述罪分别最高可判处25年和5年监禁。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）还对莱夫特和他的公司Citron Research提起了一起单独的民事欺诈诉讼，声称他从该计划中赚了2000万美元。

## 围绕做空做法的争议：SEC规则及GameStop的例子

做空一家公司股票价格下跌的做法一直存在争议，反对者认为这会鼓励传播误导性信息。支持者认为，做空可以改善价格发现，并让管理层承担责任。去年，SEC通过了新的规则，要求投资者更快、更全面地披露做空头寸。

## 安德鲁·莱夫特的近期活动：GameStop和香港禁令

莱夫特对游戏零售商GameStop持怀疑态度，该公司在Roaring Kitty（Keith Gill）重新出现后股价上涨，随后筹集了30亿美元的新股。2016年，莱夫特因发表有关中国房地产开发商中国恒大的研究报告而被香港监管机构认定有罪，受到为期五年的“冷肩”禁令。

## 结论：问责制和监管行动

SEC区域主任凯特·佐拉兹（Kate Zoladz）表示，莱夫特利用了他的读者，并使用引诱和切换策略从非法收益中获利。监管机构打算让他对自己的行为负责。

 **US Charges Short Seller Andrew Left with Fraud**  
The Department of Justice (DoJ) has charged prominent short seller, Andrew Left, with more than a dozen counts of fraud. The charges allege that he made profits of at least $1amo from "a long-running market manipulation scheme". A federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted him on 17 counts of securities fraud, one count of engaging in a securities fraud scheme and one count of making false statements to federal investigators.

**Allegations Against Andrew Left: Market Manipulation & False Representation**  
According to the DoJ, Left exploited his ability to move stock prices by targeting popular stocks with retail investors on social media. He posted recommendations that manipulated the market and generated profits for himself. The indictment claims that he publicly claimed companies' share prices were too high or low, often providing a recommended target price and an implicit representation about Citron Research's trading position. This created a false impression of alignment between Left's economic incentives and his public recommendations.

**Securities Fraud Charges & Potential Penaltures: Decades In Prison Possible**  
If convicted, Andrew Left could face decades in prison. Each securities fraud count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, while the securities fraud scheme and false statements counts each carry a maximum prison term of 25 years and five years, respectively. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also filed a separate civil fraud case against Left and Citron Research, claiming that he made $20 million from the alleged scheme.

**Controversy Surrounding Short-Selling Practices: SEC Rules & GameStop Example**  
The practice of betting on a company's share price to go down has been controversial for some time, with opponents arguing that it incentivizes the spreading of misinformation. Supporters argue that short selling improves price discovery and holds management accountable. Last year, the SEC adopted new rules requiring investors to disclose short positions more quickly and fully.

**Andrew Left's Recent Activity: GameStop & Hong Kong Ban**  
Left has been vocal in his skepticism over GameStop, a video games retailer that raised $3 billion selling new shares following a surge in its price driven by the reappearance of Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill). In 2016, Left received a five-year "cold shoulder" ban from regulators in Hong Kong after being found culpable of misconduct related to a research report he published on Chinese property developer China Evergrande.

**Conclusion: Accountability & Regulatory Actions**  
The SEC's regional director, Kate Zoladz, stated that Left took advantage of his readers and used bait-and-switch tactics to profit from ill-gotten gains. The regulators intend to hold him accountable for his actions.
