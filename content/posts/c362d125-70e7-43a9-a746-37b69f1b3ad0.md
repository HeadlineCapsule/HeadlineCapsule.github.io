苹果iPhone在中国被国内智能手机竞争对手挤出了前五名

# 苹果iPhone在中国智能手机市场的份额下降，但整体表现仍好于两年前的水平

**摘要：**
在第二财季，由于华为、小米等国内手机制造商的竞争加剧，苹果的 iPhone 在四年内首次退出中国前五名智能手机销售名单。尽管市场份额下降了 3.1%，但苹果的整体市场份额仍高于 2020 年第三财季（13.6% vs 8.3%）。

**要点：**
- 中国智能手机出货量同比增长 8.9% 至 7160 万部，实现了连续三个季度的增长。
- 苹果的市场份额有所下降，但整体市场份额仍高于两年前的水平。
- 小米进入前五名销售名单，苹果的市场份额下降了 2 个百分点；Canalys 将此归因于小米的电动汽车发布和其他因素。
-华为、vivo、oppo 和荣耀等中国品牌进入前五名。
- 苹果面临来自竞争对手和中国政府对 iPhone 的打击的担忧。
- IDC 研究总监 Nabila Popal 认为，如果华为不很快引入 AI 功能，其威胁可能会减弱，因为 AI 功能预计将成为高端设备的标准配置。
- 美国银行分析师预计，由于新 AI 功能和旧型号用户升级设备，iPhone 将迎来强劲的多年更新周期。
- 苹果在年度开发者大会上推出了“Apple Intelligence”，其中包括改进的 Siri 助手、照片编辑工具、自定义表情符号生成和其他写作辅助功能等 AI 功能。

 **Summary:**  
In Q2, Apple's iPhone dropped out of China's top five smartphone sellers for the first time in four years due to increased competition from domestic handset makers like Huawei and Xiaomi. Despite a 3.1% decline in market share, Apple still holds a larger overall market share than it did in Q3 2020 (13.6% vs. 8.3%).

**Key Points:**  
- China's smartphone shipments grew by 8.9% year over year to 71.6 million units, marking a third consecutive quarter of growth.
- Apple experienced a decline in market share but still maintains a larger overall market share than it did two years ago.
- Xiaomi entered the top five sellers as Apple's market share fell by 2 percentage points; Canalys attributes this to Xiaomi's electric car launch and other factors.
- Huawei, Vivo, Oppo, and Honor are among the Chinese brands in the top five.
- Concerns about competition and government crackdown on iPhones persist for Apple.
- IDC research director Nabila Popal suggests that Huawei's threat may weaken if they don't introduce AI features soon, as these are expected to become staple elements of premium devices.
- Bank of America analysts expect a strong multiyear refresh cycle for the iPhone driven by new AI features and older model users upgrading their devices.
- Apple unveiled "Apple Intelligence" at its annual developer conference, which includes AI features like an improved Siri assistant, photo editing tools, custom emoji generation, and writing aids.
