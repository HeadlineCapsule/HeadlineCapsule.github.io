特朗普在第二季度拥有比拜登更大的现金优势。

**摘要**  
在2024年第二季度，共和党候选人唐纳德·特朗普声称他比民主党竞争对手乔·拜登为他们的连任竞选筹集了更多资金。根据特朗普在其社交媒体平台Truth Social上的声明，据报道，他收集了3.31亿美元，而拜登的筹款额为2.64亿美元。拜登竞选团队回应称，6月是他们筹款金额最高的月份，共筹集了1.27亿美元，并强调他们的基层行动正在不断壮大。

尽管特朗普在关键摇摆州的民意调查中领先，但两位候选人都继续加紧筹款努力，因为11月的选举日益临近。拜登竞选团队也得到了格伦·图尔曼（Glen Tullman）和鲍勃·克拉克（Bob Clark）等顶级捐赠者的支持，他们称赞了拜登的成就记录，并对他的连任竞选充满信心。

然而，一些民主党官员和捐赠者质疑拜登是否应该因年龄和上周糟糕的辩论表现而让位给下一代。与此同时，两位候选人都寻求小额捐赠者和亿万富翁的捐款，因为他们为有史以来最昂贵的美国总统选举做准备。

 **Summary**  
In the second quarter of 2024, Republican candidate Donald Trump claimed he raised more funds than Democratic rival Joe Biden for their re-election campaigns. According to Trump's statement on his social media platform Truth Social, he reportedly collected $331 million compared to Biden’s $2amo. The Biden campaign countered by announcing its best fundraising month in June with a total of $127 million and highlighting their growing grassroots operation.

Despite Trump's lead in the polls for pivotal swing states, both candidates continue to intensify their fundraising efforts as November’s vote approaches. The Biden campaign also received support from top donors like Glen Tullman and Bob Clark who praised Biden's record of accomplishments and expressed confidence in his re-election bid.

However, some Democratic officials and donors have questioned whether Biden should step aside for the next generation due to concerns over his age and mental fitness following a disastrous debate performance last week. Meanwhile, both candidates seek contributions from small-dollar donors and billionaires as they prepare for what is expected to be the most expensive US presidential campaign in history.
