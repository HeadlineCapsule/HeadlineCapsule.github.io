霍华德·舒尔茨反对星巴克与激进投资者埃利奥特的和解。

**霍华德·舒尔茨** 反对 **星巴克** 与激进投资者 **埃利奥特投资管理公司** 之间的潜在和解。尽管不再担任该咖啡连锁公司的正式职务，但这位前首席执行官仍公开批评其现任管理层。

- 霍华德·舒尔茨是星巴克的第六大股东，其持股市值约 16亿美元。
- 埃利奥特投资管理公司以其激进的投资风格而闻名，已在美国星巴克建立了一个可观的少数股东地位，并私下推动变革，包括要求董事会代表。
- 舒尔茨反对和解协议，因为他相信星巴克应该更多地关注其价值观和文化，将其作为成功和绩效的主要驱动力。
- 这位亿万富翁前首席执行官曾三次领导该公司：从 1986 年到 2017 年，然后从 2008 年到 2017 年，以及最近在 2022 年到 2023 年担任临时首席执行官。他去年被拉克斯曼·纳拉西曼接替。
- 自 2024 年以来，星巴克股价下跌了约 20%，季度同店销售额下降，今年早些时候削减了财务指导。
- 过去一年来，该公司对其董事会进行了调整，包括新成员尼尔·莫汉（YouTube）和迈克·西弗特（T-Mobile）。微软首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉今年春天离开了董事会。

 **Howard Schultz** opposes a potential settlement between **Starbucks** and activist investor **Elliott Investment Management**. The former CEO of the coffee chain has publicly criticized its current management, despite no longer having a formal role at the company.

- Howard Schultz is Starbucks's sixth-largest shareholder with a holding worth about $1. 6 billion.
- Elliott Investment Management, known for being an aggressive investor, has built a sizeable minority stake in Starbucks and has privately pushed for change, including board representation.
- Schultz's opposition to the settlement is based on his belief that Starbucks should focus more on its values and culture as primary drivers of success and performance.
- The billionaire former CEO led the company three separate times: from 1986 to 2017, then again from 2008 to 2017, and most recently as interim CEO in 2n22 to n23. He was succeeded by Laxman Narasimhan last year.
- Starbucks's share price has fallen about 20% since the start of 2024, with a decline in quarterly comparable store sales and cut financial guidance earlier this year.
- The company made changes to its board over the past year, including new members such as Neal Mohan (YouTube) and Mike Sievert (T-Mobile). Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella left the board this spring.
