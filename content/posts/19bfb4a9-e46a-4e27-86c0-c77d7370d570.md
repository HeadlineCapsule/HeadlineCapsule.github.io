亚马逊将建设一个价值13亿美元的澳大利亚国防云

**亚马逊网络服务 (AWS)** 获得了一项价值 13 亿美元的合同，用于为澳大利亚国防云建立三个数据中心，旨在加强与英国和美国等盟国之间的数据共享。此协议将促进五眼情报联盟成员之间的情报和军事信息交流，该联盟包括 **澳大利亚**、美国、英国、新西兰和加拿大。

该合同还侧重于利用人工智能 (AI) 进行数据分析，以改善与美国的互操作性并建立一支更有韧性的国防部队。根据澳大利亚信号总监 Rachel Noble 的说法，基于云的人工智能将加强澳大利亚十个不同政府机构的情报工作。

来自 ASPI 智库的 Mike Bareja 强调，该 AWS 合同符合印度-太平洋地区的战略 imperative，并将促进超越安全文件交换的数据共享。预计云平台和人工智能功能将使政府机构能够更快地做出决策，并支持 Aukus 协议第二支柱下的先进技术共享。

AWS 之前在全球获得了 "最高机密" 云合同，因为它在 201amo 与美国情报部门签订了 6亿美元的交易，并扩大到了其他公司，如微软和 IBM。英国政府也在 2021 年与 AWS 签署了类似的价值 10 亿英镑的合同，重点是人工智能集成及其顶级情报机构之间的数据共享。

澳大利亚国防云项目是由该国增加国防支出的承诺资助的，这是为应对与中国之间可能出现的地缘政治紧张局势而进行的准备。这一举措与澳大利亚议会发生的一起抗议者事件同时发生，突显了发展高科技战略能力和应对基本安全威胁所面临的挑战。

 **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** secures a $1.3 billion contract to build three data centers for Australia's defense cloud, aiming to enhance data sharing with allies such as the UK and US. This deal will allow greater intelligence and military information exchange among members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which includes **Australia**, the US, UK, New Zealand, and Canada.

The contract also focuses on utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis to improve interoperability with the US and create a more resilient defense force. The use of cloud-based AI will strengthen Australia's intelligence work across 10 different government agencies, as stated by Rachel Noble, director-general of the Australian Signals Directorate.

Mike Bareja from ASPI think tank emphasizes that this AWS contract aligns with strategic imperatives in the Indo-Pacific region and will facilitate data sharing beyond secure document exchange. The cloud platform and AI capabilities are expected to enable faster decision-making by government agencies, as well as support advanced technology sharing under the Aukus pact's Pillar II.

AWS has previously secured "top secret" cloud contracts worldwide since winning a $600 million deal with US intelligence services in 201amo and expanding to include other companies like Microsoft and IBM. The UK government also signed a similar contract with AWS worth up to £1 billion in 2021, focusing on AI integration and data sharing within its top three intelligence agencies.

The Australian defense cloud project is funded by the country's increased commitment to boosting defense spending as part of preparations for potential geopolitical tensions with China. This initiative coincides with an incident at the Australian parliament involving protesters, highlighting the challenges faced in developing high-tech strategic capabilities and addressing basic security threats.
