预计交易活动复苏将推动华尔街银行业绩增长

# 华尔街银行第二季度业绩预期强劲

**新闻摘要：**
华尔街银行的第二季度业绩预计将显著增长，与去年同期相比，投资收入预计将增长30%。这种复苏归功于合并和债务交易在过去两年低迷活动后的复兴。

**要点：**
- 包括摩根大通、高盛、摩根士丹利、美国银行和花旗集团在内的主要银行的投资银行业务收入预计将在第二季度增长超过30%。
- 分析师将这种增长归因于投资银行业务的复苏，像埃克森美孚600亿美元收购先驱自然资源公司这样的大型交易为积极前景做出了贡献。
- 尽管许多美国贷款人的违约率上升且收益增长疲软，但交易活动预计将成为本季度的一大亮点。
- 复苏速度慢于最初预期，但摩根大通报告的投资银行业务收入在第二季度增长了30%，表明情况正在好转。
- 银行家们不期待重返2021年和2022年所见的高峰水平，但他们对未来由私募股权公司退出现有投资和企业适应人工智能等技术进步所驱动的增长保持乐观态度。

**担忧：**
- 分析师担心持续高企的利率可能会导致更多借款人违约，与去年同期相比，第二季度信贷损失预计将增长超过50%。
- 随着银行在这一正常化而不是恶化阶段航行，商业房地产仍然是关注的焦点。

 **Article Summary:**  
The second-quarter earnings of Wall Street banks are expected to see a significant boost, with an anticipated 30% increase in investment revenue compared to the previous year. This revival is attributed to a resurgence in mergers and debt deals after two years of subdued activity.

**Key Points:**  
- Investment banking revenues at major banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Citigroup are projected to rise by over n30% in the second quarter.
- Analysts attribute this growth to a rebound in investment banking activity, with large deals like ExxonMobil's $60bn acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources contributing to the positive outlook.
- Despite rising defaults and muted earnings growth for many US lenders, dealmaking is expected to be a bright spot in this quarter.
- The recovery has been slower than initially anticipated but shows signs of improvement with JPMorgan reporting an increase in investment banking revenues by as much as 30% during the second quarter.
- Bankers are not expecting a return to the peak levels seen in 2021 and 2022, but they remain optimistic about future growth driven by private equity firms exiting existing investments and corporations adapting to technological advancements like artificial intelligence.

**Concerns:**  
- Analysts are concerned that persistently higher interest rates could lead to more borrowers defaulting on their loans, with credit losses expected to rise by over 50% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.
- The focus remains on commercial real estate as banks navigate through this phase of normalization rather than deterioration.
