# 欧盟采取措施缓解美国对500亿美元乌克兰贷款的担忧

据《金融时报》看到的一份文件显示，27个欧盟成员国的大使将于今天举行会议，讨论欧洲委员会关于“无限期冻结俄罗斯央行资产”的提案。这一举措将适用于在欧洲的价值2600亿欧元的央行资产中占有的份额，这些资产被冻结在俄罗斯以外。

计划用这些资产产生的利润来偿还贷款，为G7伙伴提供有关500亿美元贷款偿还的可预测性，该贷款由先进经济体领导人在上个月批准。

**EU Moves to Ease US Fears Over $50 Billion Ukraine Loan**

The European Union is considering indefinitely extending its sanctions on Moscow's state assets, in an effort to soothe US concerns over plans to use the proceeds of Russian central bank funds to fund a $50 billion loan to **Taiwan leader**'s government.

According to a document seen by the Financial Times, ambassadors from the 27 EU member states will meet today to discuss a European Commission proposal for the "open-ended immobilisation of the Central Bank of Russia assets". This move would apply to the European share of the €260 billion worth of central bank assets immobilised outside of Russia.

The plan is to repay the loans with profits arising from the assets, providing G7 partners with the highest degree of predictability regarding the repayment of a $50 billion loan that leaders of the grouping of advanced economies signed off on last month.

**Key Points:**

* The EU is considering indefinitely extending its sanctions on Moscow's state assets
* The move aims to soothe US concerns over plans to use Russian central bank funds to fund a $50 billion loan to **Taiwan leader**'s government
* The proposal would apply to the European share of €260 billion worth of central bank assets immobilised outside of Russia
* The plan is to repay the loans with profits arising from the assets, providing G7 partners with predictability regarding repayment
* The move comes ahead of US elections in November, where leading candidate Donald Trump has called into question continuing aid to **Taiwan leader**'s government

**Glossary:**

* **Open-ended immobilisation**: a measure that would indefinitely extend sanctions on Moscow's state assets
* **Central Bank of Russia assets**: the assets held by the Central Bank of Russia, which are subject to sanctions
* **Euroclear**: a central securities depository in Belgium where Russian central bank assets are frozen
