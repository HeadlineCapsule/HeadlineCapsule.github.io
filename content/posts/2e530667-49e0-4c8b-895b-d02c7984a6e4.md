生物技术投资人、Moderna背后的推手筹集了36亿美元用于新创业

**生物技术投资者Moderna的后台投资者为新创业公司筹集了36亿美元**

推出Moderna的风险投资基金Flagship Pioneering已确保了36亿美元的资金，用于资助和启动一系列利用生成式人工智能（AI）进行药物开发的生物技术新公司。这笔投资将在未来三年内使用，是Flagship第八次募资的一部分，其中包括第8期基金的26亿美元以及平行基金的10亿美元，这些基金针对诊断或治疗等特定部门。

Flagship Pioneering计划专注于以创新方式利用AI进行药物开发的平台，并有可能通过其第8期基金投资约25家公司。该公司今年晚些时候计划再筹集10亿美元，使该投资工具的目标达到30亿美元。

这家风险投资公司打算利用AI作为想象的辅助工具来发展想法，并显著提高科学家们提出假设的能力。FlagshipPioneering的投资组合中有40家公司，并为它们提供内部想法，从头开始建立它们，然后再引入外部投资者。

Flagship最近的筹款被视为生物技术风险投资的牛市信号，因为在疫情后的经济衰退和利率上升之后，人们正在努力恢复。总部位于马萨诸塞州剑桥的FlagshipPioneering管理着140亿美元的资产，使其成为世界上最大的专业生物技术投资者之一。

Flagship已经在AI方面进行了大量投资，包括Generate Biomedicines，该公司去年完成了一轮生物技术领域最大规模的融资。该公司正越来越多地通过其Pioneering Medicines部门专注于个体药物开发，并与诺和诺德（Novo Nordisk）和辉瑞（Pfizer）等制药集团合作。

总之，FlagshipPioneering最近筹集的36亿美元将支持利用AI进行药物开发的生物技术新公司的启动，重点是各个部门的创新平台和个体药物开发。

 **Biotech Investor Behind Moderna Raises $3.6 Billion for New Ventures**

Flagship Pioneering, the venture capital fund that launched Moderna, has secured $3.6 billion in funding to finance and launch a series of new biotechs harnessing generative artificial intelligence (AI) for pharmaceutical development. The investment will be used over the next three years and is part of Flagship's eighth fundraise, which includes $2.6 billion in its eighth fund and an additional $1 billion across parallel funds targeting specific sectors such as diagnostics or therapeutics.

Flagship Pioneering plans to focus on platforms that use AI in novel ways for drug development, with the potential of investing in around 25 companies through its eighth fund. The company aims to raise an additional $1 billion later this year, reaching a target of $3 billion for the investment vehicle.

The venture capital firm intends to develop ideas using AI as a prosthesis for imagination and leap dramatically in hypothesis generation for scientists. Flagship Pioneering has 40 companies in its portfolio and generates ideas for them in-house, building them from the ground up before bringing in outside investors.

Flagship's latest raise is seen as a bullish sign for venture investment in biotech amidst recovery efforts following a downturn caused by the end of pandemic-inspired boom and interest rate hikes. Flagship Pioneering, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has $14 billion in assets under management, making it one of the world's largest specialist biotech investors.

Flagship already has significant AI investments, including Generate Biomedicines which completed the biggest funding round for a biotech last year. The company is increasingly focusing on individual drug development through its Pioneering Medicines arm, partnering with pharma groups such as Novo Nordisk and Pfizer.

In summary, Flagship Pioneering's recent $3.6 billion fundraise will support the launch of new biotechs utilizing AI for pharmaceutical development, focusing on novel platforms and individual drug development in various sectors.
