Meta 探索在雷朋眼镜制造商 EssilorLuxottica 的股份

# **Meta 考虑投资欧洲眼镜集团 EssilorLuxottica**

- 在 Ray-Ban Meta 成功发布后，Meta 正在考虑向法意集团 EssilorLuxottica 投资数十亿欧元，以扩大他们的智能眼镜合作伙伴关系。
- 这家硅谷公司正在探索在 EssilorLuxottica 收购少量股份，并在这件事上与摩根士丹利合作。然而，该投资是否会实现仍不确定。
- 这两家公司已经合作开发了集成了 Facebook 和 Instagram 等社交媒体平台的智能眼镜。这些眼镜的最新版本在几个月内售出了比前两个版本更多的单位。
- EssilorLuxottica 是全球最大的眼镜制造商，一直专注于收购来发展其技术组合。他们最近收购了美国街头品牌 Supreme，并投资了德国公司 Heidelberg Engineering，该公司专门从事眼科手术技术。
- Meta 和苹果都在竞争开发不侵入性的增强现实眼镜，这些眼镜可能取代智能手机成为下一个计算设备。然而，由于人们担心在脸上佩戴笨重的设备，消费者采用仍是一个挑战。

 **Meta's Potential Investment in European Eyewear Group EssilorLuxottica**

- Meta is considering investing billions of euros in the Franco-Italian group EssilorLuxottica to expand their smart glasses partnership, following successful launches of Ray-Ban Meta.
- The Silicon Valley company has been exploring a small stake in EssilorLuxottica and is working with Morgan Stanley on this matter. However, there's no guarantee that the investment will take place.
- Both companies have collaborated to create smart glasses integrated with social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The latest version of these glasses sold more units in a few months than previous versions did in two years.
- EssilorLuxottica, the world's largest eyewear manufacturer, has been focusing on acquisitions to grow its technology portfolio. Recently, they acquired US streetwear label Supreme and invested in German company Heidelberg Engineering specializing in eye surgery techneboxes.
- Meta and Apple are competing to develop unintrusive augmented reality glasses that could replace smartphones as the next computing device. However, consumer adoption remains a challenge due to concerns about wearing cumbersome devices on their face.
