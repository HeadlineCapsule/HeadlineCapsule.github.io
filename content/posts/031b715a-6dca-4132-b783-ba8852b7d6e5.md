前卫投资者警告公司股票限制

# 先驱者警告投资者

先驱者（Vanguard）警告投资者，由于美国监管机构可能采取行动，其持有的公司股份可能会受到限制，这可能会增加指数追踪基金的成本和风险。

先驱者是一家被动投资巨头，因其规模庞大且在气候和社会问题上的投票记录而受到审查，活动人士对这些大型基金掌握的权力表示担忧。

传统上，只要投资基金不寻求管理角色，就可以超过银行和公用事业所有权上限；然而，监管机构现在正在考虑对这些豁免进行更严格的限制。

联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）正在考虑更严格的监管，同时共和党州检察长敦促联邦能源监管委员会审查先驱者在公开交易的公用事业中持有大量股份的能力。

先驱者警告说，它可能无法在未来始终突破所有权上限，这可能会导致出售证券并通过衍生品或投资子公司购买间接敞口。这种变化可能会对基金费用、绩效和投资者的税收产生负面影响。

投资公司协会（ICI）对重手监管可能影响美国投资者的回报表示担忧，并敦促监管机构考虑潜在的负面影响，即影响美国人保障财务未来的能力。

 **Summary:**  

- **Vanguard warns investors** about potential restrictions on the size of stakes it can hold in companies, which could increase costs and risks for index tracking funds. The asset manager has updated disclosures to highlight this risk due to possible enforcement by US regulators.

- Vanguard is one of three passive investment giants facing scrutiny over its size and voting record on climate and social issues, with activists raising concerns about the power held by these large funds.

- Historically, investment funds have been allowed to exceed ownership caps for banks and utilities as long as they do not seek a management role; however, regulators are now considering tighter conditions on those waivers.

- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is contemplating stricter regulations, while Republican state attorneys general have urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to review Vanguard's ability to hold large shares of publicly traded utilities.

- **Vanguard** has warned that it may not always be able to breach ownership maximums in the future, which could lead to selling off securities and buying indirect exposure using derivatives or investing in subsidiaries. This change could negatively impact fund expenses, performance, and tax consequences for investors.

- The Investment Company Institute (ICI) has expressed concerns about heavy-handed regulation affecting returns for US investors and urges regulators to consider the potential negative impacts on Americans' ability to secure a financial future.
