阿拉伯联合酋长国判43名活动人士终身监禁

阿拉伯联合酋长国（UAE）因一项被人权活动人士称为“公然不公平”的审判，判43名活动家终身监禁。阿布扎比联邦上诉法院判处53名被告有罪，其中包括穆斯林兄弟会恐怖组织的领导人和其他成员。其中，**43人被判处终身监禁**，另有**10人被判10至15年监禁**。

人权组织认为，这些被指控者是人权活动家、政府批评者和民主倡导者。海湾君主制国家在去年联合国COP28气候会议期间对数十人提出了恐怖主义指控。这次审判被认为是UAE有史以来第二大大规模审判，涉及**80多名被告**。许多人在2013年的原始审判中就已被关押超过十年。

被判终身监禁的人权律师穆罕默德·罗肯（Mohammed al-Roken）来自阿联酋被拘留者倡导中心。罗肯之前因密谋叛乱而被判处10年监禁，并于2013年服满刑期。阿布扎比法院裁定，被定罪者与穆斯林兄弟会关联团体有关联，并指控他们试图煽动暴力抗议。

对**53名被告**的判决可以上诉，另有24人的案件被驳回，一人无罪释放。人权观察组织的研究员乔伊·谢亚（Joey Shea）批评这场审判是“司法嘲讽”，指出存在程序违规和酷刑指控。来自阿联酋被拘留者倡导中心的穆罕默德·扎比（Mohamed al-Zaabi）将审判描述为“假象”。

UAE坚持认为，其严厉的安全立场保护了该国免受政治不稳定的影响，但人权组织认为，这次大规模审判损害了该国的进步形象，并引发了对司法公正的担忧。

 **United Arab Emirates** sentences 43 activists to life in prison following a trial deemed "shamelessly unfair" by human rights campaigners. The Abu Dhabi federal appeals court convicted 53 defendants, including leaders and members of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood organization. Of these, **43 were sentenced to life** in jail while a further **10 received prison terms of 10 to 15 years**.

Human rights groups argue that those accused are human rights activists, government critics, and democracy advocates. The Gulf monarchy initially brought the terrorism charges against dozens during the UN COP28 climate conference last year. This trial is considered the UAE's second-largest mass trial ever, with over **80 defendants** involved. Many have been in jail for more than a decade since their original 2013 trials.

Among those sentenced to life imprisonment was human rights lawyer Mohammed al-Roken from the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Centre. Roken had previously served a 10-year sentence in 2013, after being charged with plotting rebellion. The Abu Dhabi court ruled that convicted individuals were involved with a group affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and accused them of attempting to incite violent protests.

The verdicts against the **53 defendants** can be appealed, while cases for 24 others were dismissed and one was acquitted. Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea criticized the trial as a "mockery of justice," citing due process violations and torture allegations. Mohamed al-Zaabi from the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Centre described the trial as a "facade."

The UAE maintains that its tough stance on security protects it from political instability, but human rights groups argue that this mass trial damages the country's progressive image and raises concerns about justice being carried out.
