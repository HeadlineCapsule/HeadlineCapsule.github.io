特朗普密友史蒂夫·班农向联邦监狱投降

史蒂夫·班农，前白宫顾问和唐纳德·特朗普的 vocal 支持者，因藐视国会而被定罪后向联邦监狱投降。由于拒绝遵守调查 2021 年 1 月 6 日特朗普支持者袭击美国国会大厦的国会委员会发出的传票，他将被关押在康涅狄格州一所监狱四个月。

班农帮助建立特朗普的“让美国再次伟大”（MAGA）运动，并曾担任布雷巴特新闻的前主席，他在最近几天对自己的指控大声疾呼，称自己是“政治犯”，被美国司法部起诉以压制 MAGA。

最高法院周五拒绝了班农的上诉，使他加入了大约六名特朗普的密友行列，他们因各种罪名被判入狱。其他值得注意的人物包括彼得·纳瓦罗，他是一名前白宫贸易顾问，因类似指控而被定罪，今年早些时候被判入狱。

班农于周一上午被联邦监狱局正式收押。他的入狱正值最高法院准备就特朗普是否因其总统任期内的行为而享有刑事起诉豁免权作出裁决之际，特朗普面临着州级和联邦一级的三项单独起诉。

班农的法律团队认为，他认为自己在特朗普的行政特权下受到保护，尽管班农在 2017 年离开了白宫首席战略师的职位。然而，政府律师争辩说，要求班农提供的许多证据不享受特权，而且他在特朗普放弃其行政特权索赔后拒绝与该委员会合作。

特朗普因与“封口费”付款相关的纽约欺诈定罪将于 7 月 11 日被判刑，但预计不会被判入狱。

 **Steve Bannon**, a former White House adviser and vocal advocate for Donald Trump, has surrendered to federal prison following a conviction on contempt of Congress charges. He is set to serve four months in a Connecticut facility after refusing to comply with a subpoena from the congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump's supporters.

Bannon, who helped build Trump's **Make America Great Again (MAGA)** movement and was former chair of Breitbart News, has been vocal about his charges in recent days, calling himself a "political prisoner" being prosecuted by the US justice department to silence MAGA.

The Supreme Court denied Bannon's appeal on Friday, leading him to join roughly half a dozen Trump confidants who have served time in jail. Other notable figures include Peter Navarro, a former White House trade adviser convicted of similar charges and sentenced to prison earlier this year.

Bannon was officially taken into custody by the Federal Bureau of Prisons on Monday morning. His imprisonment comes as the Supreme Court is set to rule on whether Trump himself can be immune from criminal prosecution for actions taken during his presidency, facing three separate indictments at state and federal levels.

Bannon's legal team argued that he believed he was protected under Trump's executive privilege, even though Bannon had left the White House position as chief strategist in 2e17. However, government lawyers contended that much of the evidence requested from Bannon was not privileged and that he refused to cooperate with the committee after Trump waived his executive privilege claim.

Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11 for a New York fraud conviction related to "hush money" payments, but jail time is not expected.
