香港监管机构驳回了有关普华永道（PwC）的举报人指控，但恒大调查仍在继续

香港审计监管机构清除了PwC的举报人指控。

- 香港会计及财务汇报局（AFRC）清除德勤，驳回了匿名举报人提出的许多爆炸性指控。这些说法与该公司为已倒闭的中国房地产开发商恒大所做的工作有关。
- AFRC表示，它没有发现任何证据支持有关质量控制有缺陷、对审计质量的不适当监督以及违反专业标准的严重指控，这些指控涉及PwC香港客户选择。
- 尽管驳回了这些指控，但对PwC为恒大所做工作的调查仍在进行中。此外，由于其对恒大子公司进行的审计，PwC在中国内地的姐妹公司可能面临北京的处罚。
- AFRC审查了PwC对举报人索赔的内部调查，并发现三项主要指控没有证据支持。
- PwC香港和PwC Zhong Tian在同一个管理下运营，由于对恒大倒闭的监管关注，这两个公司最近几个月都经历了客户流失。
- 2021年3月，中国证券监督管理委员会指控恒大在其倒闭之前夸大收入780亿美元。自2009年上市以来，PwC香港一直是恒大的审计师，而恒大子公司恒大地产则由PwC Zhong Tian审计。
- 今年，这两个PwC公司失去了30多个上市公司作为审计客户，包括中国国有实体，如中国太平保险和中国招商银行。

 **Hong Kong's Audit Regulator Clears PwC Over Whistleblower Claims**  

- The Accounting and Financial Reporting Council (AFRC) in Hong Kong has cleared PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), rejecting many explosive allegations made by an anonymous whistleblower. These claims were related to the firm's work for collapsed Chinese property developer Evergrande.
- The AFRC stated that it found no evidence supporting serious accusations of faulty quality controls, inappropriate oversight of audit quality, and breaches of professional standards regarding client selection at PwC Hong Kong.
- Despite clearing these allegations, the investigation into PwC's work for Evergrande itself is still ongoing. Additionally, PwC's sister firm in mainland China may face penalties from Beijing due to its audit of an Evergrande subsidiary.
- The AFRC reviewed internal investigations conducted by PwC into the whistleblower claims and found that three major allegations were not supported by evidence.
- Both PwC Hong Kong and PwC Zhong Tian, which operate under the same management, have experienced client defections in recent months due to regulatory scrutiny over Evergrande's collapse.
- In March 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission accused Evergrande of inflating revenues by $78 billion before its collapse. PwC Hong Kong had been Evergrande's auditor since its listing in 2009, while Hengda Real Estate, an Evergrande subsidiary, was audited by PwC Zhong Tian.
- The two PwC firms have lost over 30 publicly listed companies as audit clients this year, including Chinese state-owned entities such as China Taiping Insurance and China Merchants Bank.
