谷歌母公司正在谈判以230亿美元收购网络安全初创公司Wiz

**谷歌母公司字母表**正在讨论以约230亿美元收购网络安全初创公司**Wiz**，这将是该公司有史以来规模最大的收购。谈判仍在进行中，由于细节尚未解决，交易可能无法达成。

如果达成协议，这将是对近年来一直在审查科技公司在该领域新兴公司的收购的反垄断监管机构的考验。字母表上一次重大收购是在十多年前以125亿美元收购**摩托罗拉移动**。

该潜在收购将是字母表在网络安全领域的又一重大举措，此前该公司于2019年以54亿美元收购了Mandiant。Wiz由Assaf Rappaport创立，总部位于纽约，成立四年来已从投资者那里筹集了约20亿美元。这家初创公司的估值约为120亿美元，其客户包括Salesforce、火星公司和宝马公司。

Wiz专门帮助公司保护其在云中的程序，随着企业越来越多地运营软件并在线存储数据，这导致了收入显着增长。该公司报告了约3.5亿美元的年度递延收入。与Wiz的交易将是涉及风险投资支持公司的最大收购之一。

Wiz拒绝对谈判发表评论，而谷歌则没有立即回应评论请求。

 **Google parent Alphabet** is in discussions to acquire cyber security start-up **Wiz** for approximately $23 billion, marking what would be the largest acquisition in its history. The talks are still ongoing and could potentially fall apart due to unresolved details.

If a deal were reached, it would serve as a test case for antitrust regulators who have been scrutinizing tech companies' acquisitions of emerging firms within the sector in recent years. Alphabet's last significant acquisition occurred over a decade ago with the $12.amo purchase of **Motorola Mobility**.

The potential acquisition would represent another major move into cyber security for Alphabet, following its 2019 Mandiant acquisition worth $5.4 billion. Wiz, founded by Assaf Rappaport and headquartered in New York, has raised around $2 billion from investors since its establishment four years ago. The start-up is valued at approximately $12 billion and counts Salesforce, Mars, and BMW among its customers.

Wiz specializes in helping companies secure their programs in the cloud, which has led to a significant increase in revenue as corporations increasingly operate software and store data online. The company reported an annual recurring revenue of about $350 million. A deal with Wiz would be one of the largest acquisitions involving a venture capital-backed company.

Wiz has declined to comment on the talks, while Google did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
