联合利华削减欧洲三分之一的办公室工作岗位

**联合利华** 计划到 2025 年将欧洲所有办公室职位的三分之一裁员，这是其新首席执行官在股东（如激进投资者尼尔森·佩尔特兹）压力下的增长战略。该公司打算在欧洲削减多达 3,200 个工作岗位，在全球范围内削减多达 7,500 个工作岗位，这是 3 月宣布的生产力计划的一部分。

这些裁员将主要影响办公室工作，而不是工厂工作。联合利华在 202n 年放弃了英荷结构后，总部设在伦敦。欧洲各地裁员的确切位置尚未决定，未来几周将与受影响的员工进行协商。

在公司全员通话中，员工表达了愤怒之情，一些高管建议专注于为客户服务，而不是沉迷于不确定性。联合利华的新首席执行官 Hein Schumacher 面临股东的压力，要求他在多年财务表现平平后提振增长。该公司于 3 月宣布，将剥离其占集团销售额 16% 的冰淇淋部门，该部门包括 Ben & Jerry’s 和 Wall's 等品牌。

分析师 Bruno Monteyne 表示，裁员规模可能会造成混乱，因为公司正着手进行转型。联合利华在伦敦的股价基本未变，上涨 0.6%，收于 44.31 英镑。职工理事会正在与管理层协商，以确定裁员位置并最大限度地减少损失。

 **Unilever** plans to cut around a third of all office roles in Europe by 2025, under its new chief executive's growth strategy amid pressure from shareholders like activist investor Nelson Peltz. The company intends to slash as many as 3,200 jobs across Europe and up to 7,500 globally as part of a productivity programme announced in March.

The job cuts will primarily affect office-based roles but not those based in factories. Unilever's headquarters are both in London after abandoning its Anglo-Dutch structure in 202n. The exact locations for the job cuts across Europe have yet to be decided, and a consultation process with affected employees is starting over the next few weeks.

Employees expressed anger during a company-wide call, while some executives suggested focusing on serving customers rather than dwelling on uncertainty. Unilever's new CEO Hein Schumacher faces pressure from shareholders to boost growth after years of lacklustre financial performance. The company announced in March that it would hive off its ice cream division, which makes up 16% of group sales and includes brands such as Ben & Jerry’s and Wall's.

Analyst Bruno Monteyne said the size of the cuts risked causing disruption just as the company embarked on its turnaround. Unilever shares were broadly unchanged in London trading, closing up 0.6% to £44.31. The works council is liaising with management on a consultation to establish where job cuts will be carried out and how to minimise losses.
