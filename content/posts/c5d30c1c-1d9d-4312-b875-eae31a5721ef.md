人工智能初创公司 Cohere 筹集了 5亿美元资金，旨在与 OpenAI 一决高下

# 人工智能初创公司 Cohere 筹集 5亿美元

加拿大人工智能开发商 Cohere 在新融资轮中筹集了 5亿美元，使其估值达到 55亿美元。这家由前谷歌研究人员于 2019 年创立的公司正在与 OpenAI 和 Anthropic 等大型竞争对手竞争，以争取希望将人工智能集成到其业务中的公司的有利可图的合同。

**融资细节：**

这次融资包括新投资者和现有投资者 PSP Investments、Nvidia、Oracle、Salesforce Ventures 和 Fujitsu 的贡献。Cohere 计划今年将员工人数增加一倍，达到 500 人，并利用筹集的资金来开发新的模型、计算能力和人力。

**人工智能开发的竞争：**

与 OpenAI（估值 900 亿美元）和 Anthropic（200 亿美元）不同，Cohere 没有为消费者开发人工智能聊天机器人，而是专注于面向企业客户的人工智能模型。这种更窄的关注范围使 Cohere 能够比竞争对手更具成本效益地构建、训练和运行大型语言模型。

**收入增长：**

Cohere 的收入显著增长，3 月份的年化收入达到 3500 万美元，几乎是 2023 年年底 1300 万美元的三倍。该公司去年 6 月筹集了 2.7亿美元，并继续在 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 于 11 月推出后积极竞争，该产品由微软支持，以及 Anthropic 与谷歌和亚马逊的支持。

**结论：**

Cohere，一家由前谷歌研究人员创立的加拿大初创公司，已筹集了 5亿美元的资金，与 OpenAI 和 Anthropic 等大型竞争对手竞争。该公司专注于企业客户，使其能够构建具有成本效益的人工智能模型，从而促进其收入迅速增长。

 **AI Start-up Cohere Raises $500 Million**  

Canadian AI developer Cohere has raised $500 million in a new funding round, valuing the company at $5.5 billion. Founded by former Google researchers in 2019, Cohere is competing with larger rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic to secure lucrative contracts for companies looking to integrate AI into their businesses.

**Funding Round Details:**  
The funding round included contributions from new and existing investors like PSP Investments, Nvidia, Oracle, Salesforce Ventures, and Fujitsu. Cohere plans to double its staff to about 500 this year with the capital raised going towards new models, computing power, and headcount.

**Competition in AI Development:**  
Unlike OpenAI (valued at $90 billion) and Anthropic ($20 billion), Cohere has not developed an AI chatbot for consumers but focuses on enterprise customers with its AI models. This narrower focus allows Cohere to build, train, and run their large language model more cost-effectively than competitors.

**Revenue Growth:**  
Cohere's revenues have grown significantly, reaching $35 million in March on an annualized basis, almost tripling from $13 million at the end of 2023. The company raised $270 million in June last year and continues to compete aggressively within the AI sector since OpenAI's ChatGPT launch in November amoled by Microsoft and Anthropic with Google and Amazon.

**Conclusion:**  
Cohere, a Canadian start-up founded by former Google researchers, has raised $500 million in funding to compete against larger rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic. The company's focus on enterprise customers allows it to build cost-effective AI models, contributing to its rapid revenue growth.
