银行家谨慎对待美国公司募资激增

# 美国企业筹资活动在2024年上半年显著增长

美国企业通过高评级和垃圾级债务市场的借贷在2024年上半年大幅增加，借贷额达到1.3万亿美元，同比增长近50%。同时，首次公开募股（IPO）也增长了80%，达到近200亿美元。然而，银行家们对这一趋势是否能持续持谨慎态度，因为即将到来的总统选举可能会带来市场波动，并且利率下调存在不确定性。

尽管强劲的投资者需求使公司能够以相对较低的溢价借贷，高于基准政府债券，但人们担心2024年剩余时间内的活动水平可能仍将保持低迷。

 **Summary:**  
US corporate fundraising experienced a significant increase in the first half of 2024, with borrowing through US high-grade and junk-rated debt markets rising almost 50% to $1.3tn, and initial public offerings (IPOs) jumping by 
80% to nearly $20bn. However, bankers express caution about the sustainability of this trend due to potential market volatility from the upcoming presidential election and uncertainty over interest rate cuts.
