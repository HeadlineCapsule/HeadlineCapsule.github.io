英国最高法院裁定，如果飞行员请病假，航空公司必须赔偿。

# 英国最高法院关于飞行员生病导致航班取消的赔偿裁决

英国最高法院最近裁定，如果航班因飞行员生病而取消，乘客应获得赔偿，这一先例预计将给航空公司带来数百万英镑的费用。这一决定源于英国航空子公司 BA Cityflyer 与一对夫妇之间的案件，他们2018 年从米兰飞往伦敦的航班因飞行员因生病未到场而取消。

法院一致裁定，员工生病不能被归类为消费者权益法下的“特殊情况”，该法此前在这种情况下免除了航空公司支付赔偿的义务。这一裁决意义重大，可能会影响每年由因飞行员生病或其他与工作人员相关的问题而航班取消的数十万乘客提出的索赔。

法院的决定强调，管理员工生病应该被视为航空公司运营中固有的部分，类似于飞机部件的磨损和损伤。这一裁决预计将对英国承运人产生重大财务影响，因为他们现在可能面临因飞行员生病或其他与工作人员相关的问题而导致航班取消的赔偿索赔。

消费者权益团体，如 Which？欢迎这一决定，强调了乘客赔偿规则的清晰度需求，并批评航空公司以前能够利用“特殊情况”豁免来避免支付赔偿。这一裁决可能会促使英国承运人重新评估因与工作人员相关的问题而导致航班取消的政策，并可能在脱欧后影响航空公司、消费者团体和监管机构之间关于乘客权利的未来讨论。

 **UK Supreme Court Ruling on Compensation for Flight Cancellations Due to Pilot Illness**

The UK's highest court recently ruled that passengers should receive compensation if a flight is cancelled due to pilot illness, setting a precedent expected to cost airlines millions of pounds. This decision stems from the case involving British Airways subsidiary BA Cityflyer and a couple whose 2018 flight from Milan to London was cancelled because the pilot did not report for work due to sickness.

The court unanimously ruled that staff illness cannot be categorized as an "extraordinary circumstance" under consumer rights law, which previously exempted airlines from paying compensation in such cases. The ruling is significant and may impact tens of thousands of claims made annually by passengers whose flights were cancelled due to pilot sickness or other staff-related issues.

The court's decision emphasizes that managing staff illness should be considered an inherent part of airline operations, similar to the wear and tear on aircraft components. This ruling is expected to have a substantial financial impact on UK carriers as they may now face compensation claims for flight cancellations caused by pilot sickness or other staff-related issues.

The decision has been welcomed by consumer rights groups, such as Which?, which highlights the need for clarity in passenger compensation rules and criticizes airlines' previous ability to avoid paying compensation under the "extraordinary circumstances" exemption. The ruling may prompt UK carriers to reassess their policies on flight cancellations due to staff-related issues, as well as potentially influence future discussions between airlines, consumer groups, and regulators regarding passenger rights in a post-Brexit environment.
