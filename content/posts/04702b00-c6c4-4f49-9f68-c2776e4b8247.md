英国可以调整公共债务规则以缓解英格兰银行损失的影响，投资者表示

# 英国调整公共债务规则

投资者建议，英国财政大臣可以放宽一些英国银行（BoE）遭受的债券损失所带来的预算影响，而不会吓坏金融市场。通过将 BoE 的资产购买设施（APF）损失的影响排除在债务规则之外，政府自己的债务规则下的额外借贷的财政 "空间" 几乎可以翻一番。

## 潜在影响和市场反应

投资者认为，只要任何额外的借贷用于投资，例如基础设施项目，市场就可以接受这种举措。然而，保持对工党政府的信任至关重要；否则，这些变化可能被视为避免公共部门削减开支。

## 量化宽松和公共财政

最初，BoE 的量化宽松通过对债券持有的利息支付增加了政府收入，这些利息支付流向了国库。然而，由于央行以亏损出售债券，而政府必须弥补这一损失，这些行动现在成为了一种负担。

## 分析师的计算和建议

来自摩根大通的分析师估计，将 BoE 损失排除在债务规则之外将比 3 月估计的 89 亿英镑增加 258 亿英镑的财政空间。这个额外的空间可以用于增加借贷，特别是投资目的。

## 工党政府的财政方法

工党政府旨在将自己描绘成财政保守派，并与以前导致国债市场动荡的政策相区分。加强预算责任办公室（OBR）对公共财政的监督可能会为进一步改变债务规则铺平道路，从而允许更多的支出灵活性。

## 财长的立场和未来计划

财长 Rachel Reeves 表示致力于继续上一届政府的财政规则，即在五年内必须降低债务-GDP 比率。她还警告说，不要推翻 BoE 如何支付商业贷款人储备的利息，这每年可以节省数十亿英镑。

## 结论和建议

调整净债务指标以将 APF 损失排除在财政规则之外，似乎比处理 BoE 债券投资组合巨大损失的其他想法更温和。然而，任何变化都应该在一个在运营上独立的中央银行内进行，该银行有一个明确的通货膨胀目标任务。

 **UK's Public Debt Rule Adjustment**: Investors suggest that the UK chancellor can ease some budgetary impact of bond losses suffered by the Bank of England (BoE) without spooking financial markets. This could be achieved by excluding the impact of losses on the BoE’s asset purchase facility (APF) from its debt rule, which would nearly triple fiscal "headroom" for extra borrowing under government's own debt rule.

**Potential Impact and Market Reaction**: Investors believe that such a move could be swallowed by the markets as long as any additional borrowing is used for investment, like infrastructure projects. However, it is essential to maintain trust in the Labour government; otherwise, changes may be perceived as avoiding public sector cuts.

**Quantitative Easing and Public Finances**: Quantitative easing by the BoE initially increased government receipts through interest payments on bond holdings flowing back to the Treasury. However, these operations have now become a burden due to central bank selling bonds at a loss, which the government must cover.

**Analysts' Calculations and Recommendations**: Analysts from JPMorgan estimate that excluding BoE losses from the debt rule would boost fiscal headroom by £25.n8bn compared to the estimated £8.9bn in March. This extra room could be used for increased borrowing, particularly for investment purposes.

**Labour Government's Fiscal Approach**: The Labour government aims to portray itself as fiscally conservative and differentiate from previous policies that caused turmoil in the gilt market. Strengthening oversight of public finances by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) could pave the way for further changes to debt rules, allowing more spending flexibility.

**Chancellor's Stance and Future Plans**: Chancellor Rachel Reeves has expressed commitment to continuing the previous government’s fiscal rule that debt-to-GDP must fall in five years' time. She also warned against overhauling how the BoE pays interest on commercial lenders' reserves, which could save billions of pounds per year.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**: Adjusting the net debt metric to exclude APF losses from fiscal rules appears less radical than other ideas for handling significant BoE bond portfolio losses. However, any changes should be made within an operationally independent central bank with a clear inflation-targeting mandate.
