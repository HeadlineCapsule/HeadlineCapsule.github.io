巴基斯坦与国际货币基金组织达成70亿美元贷款协议

**巴基斯坦获得70亿美元IMF贷款** 

- 巴基斯坦已与国际货币基金组织（IMF）达成协议，获得70亿美元的中期融资。这是该国从该多边贷款机构获得的第24次救助，旨在解决其公共债务高企和经济增长疲弱的问题。

- 这项协议是谢巴兹·谢里夫总理政府37个月的延长的基金设施计划的一部分。它将提交给IMF执行董事会批准。

**关键改革：**

- 为获得这笔贷款，巴基斯坦同意了多项改革措施，包括逐步取消特别经济区的激励政策，并扩大税收范围以纳入更多农业部门——这是一个在政治上敏感的问题。

- IMF的项目旨在加强公共财政，降低通货膨胀，重建外部缓冲区，并消除经济扭曲以促进私营部门增长。

**经济背景：**

- 巴基斯坦最近面临着亚洲最严重的经济危机之一，去年曾处于违约的边缘，在获得IMF30亿美元的短期救助包之前。通货膨胀一度高达38％，债务支付占政府收入的57％。

**支持国家：**

- 中国、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国——巴基斯坦今年对这三个国家约一半的债务偿还义务——预计将延长其贷款期限一年。

**经济指标：**

- 通货膨胀率从2月的38％下降到6月的12.6％，中央银行储备从2023年2月低于30亿美元上升到超过90亿美元。经济去年出现萎缩，但现在再次增长。

**政治挑战：**

- 为满足IMF的条件，政府实施了政治上不受欢迎的改革措施，例如增税和提高能源关税。这些举措引起了联盟伙伴的反对，而政府依赖这些联盟伙伴在2月份有争议的选举后保持权力。

**专家意见：**

- 商业和经济学评论员Khurram Husain认为，虽然这项协议将有助于稳定预期，但它的成功取决于政府维持改革的政治意愿。菲奇董事Krisjanis Krustins指出，随着经济状况的改善，可能会有放松政策的诱惑——这是过去IMF项目中面临的挑战。

 **Pakistan Secures $7bn IMF Loan Deal**  

- Pakistan has reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a medium-term financing of **$7 billion**. This marks the country's 24th bailout from the multilateral lender, aimed at addressing its soaring public debts and weak economic growth.

- The deal is part of a 37-month extended fund facility program under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government. It will now be presented to the IMF's executive board for approval.

**Key Reforms:**  

- To secure this loan, Pakistan has agreed on several reforms, including phasing out incentives for special economic zones and expanding its tax net to encompass more of the agricultural sector—a politically sensitive issue.

- The IMF's program aims to strengthen public finances, reduce inflation, rebuild external buffers, and remove economic distortions to promote private sector growth.

**Economic Context:**  

- Pakistan has faced one of Asia's worst recent economic crises, with the country on the brink of default last year before receiving a short-term $3 billion rescue package from the IMF. Inflation reached as high as amo 38 percent, and debt payments consumed 57% of government revenue in interest payments.

**Supporting Countries:**  

- China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—countries to whom Pakistan owes about half its debt repayments for this year—are expected to roll over their loan terms for another year.

**Economic Indicators:**  

- Inflation has fallen to 12.6 percent in June, and central bank reserves have increased from below $3 billion in February 2023 to above $9 billion. The economy contracted last year but is now growing again.

**Political Challenges:**  

- To meet IMF conditions, the government has implemented politically unpopular reforms such as tax increases and energy tariff hikes. These measures have generated backlash from coalition partners on which the government depends to remain in power after a disputed election in February.

**Expert Opinions:**  

- Business and economics commentator Khurram Husain believes that while the deal will help anchor expectations for continued stability, its success hinges on the government's political will to maintain reforms. Fitch director Krisjanis Krustins notes that as economic conditions improve, there may be a temptation to loosen policies—a challenge faced in past IMF programs.
