波浪运输通胀可能使利率下调复杂化，经济学家警告说。

# 经济专家警告，由于海运通胀浪潮来袭，降息可能出现复杂情况，这可能会推动商品价格上涨并放缓通货紧缩的进展。自4月以来，亚洲和北欧洲之间运输集装箱的成本翻了一番，地缘政治紧张局势加剧了这一上升趋势。

- 不断上涨的海运费用可能导致欧元区和英国消费者领导的复苏加强，公司可能会将这些费用转嫁给消费者。
- 分析师预计，由于海运通胀，欧洲中央银行（ECB）和英格兰银行（BoE）将推迟降息。
- 一些经济学家认为海运通胀的影响有限，而其他人则认为它可能会影响货币宽松政策。
- 专家表示，更高的海运成本最终会体现在消费者价格中，但不会突然发生。
- 即使商品价格小幅上涨，也可能对央行造成担忧并阻碍其货币宽松努力。

 **Article Summary:**  
Economists warn of complications in rate cuts due to a wave of shipping inflation, which may drive up the price of goods and slow disinflation progress. The cost of moving containers between Asia and northern Europe has more than doubled since April, with geopolitical tensions contributing to this rise.

**Key Points:**  
- Surging shipping costs could push inflation higher and delay interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BoE).
- The cost increase is attributed to Houthi rebel attacks, potential strikes at ports, low water levels in the Panama Canal, and early inventory buildup for the holiday season.
- Economists like Andrzej Szczepaniak from Nomura believe that companies may pass on these costs as consumer-led recovery strengthens in the eurozone and UK.
- Brian Coulton of Fitch Ratings expects central banks to delay rate cuts due to shipping inflation, while others such as Holger Schmieding (Berenberg) and Simon Macadam (Capital Economics) view it as a modest irritant with limited impact on overall inflation.
- Claus Vistesen from Pantheon Macroeconomics suggests that higher shipping costs will eventually show up in consumer prices, but not suddenly.
- Simon French of Panmure Liberum warns that even small increases in goods prices could be a concern for central banks and potentially hinder monetary easing efforts.
