伊朗强硬派因选举失利互殴

# 摘要：
在伊朗总统选举中输给改革派总统当选人马苏德·佩泽希基安（Masoud Pezhekian）后，伊朗强硬派内部出现分歧。主要竞争对手穆罕默德·巴格尔·加利布夫（Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf）和赛义德·贾利利（Saeed Jalili）未能像之前几次选举那样团结在一位候选人周围。这种分裂导致了强硬派派系之间的指责，因为他们误导了经济并相互争夺权力。

强硬派由反对与美国和解的社会保守派组成，但加利布夫被视为该政权在选举中支持的候选人。然而，佩泽希基安的意外入场导致了他的胜利。贾利利和加利布夫之间互相指责对方的竞选策略和在选举期间的涉嫌不当行为。

佩泽希基安承诺进行改革，例如放宽社交媒体限制、结束道德警察巡逻以及通过与西方解决核僵局来寻求美国制裁的缓解。然而，强硬派认为佩泽希基安无法改变由最高领袖哈梅内伊和革命卫队塑造的重要政策。

人们仍然担心伊朗的核计划和与俄罗斯的军事合作，以及如果改革派认为在强硬派对佩泽希基安政府的压力下改变国家的方向选择有限时可能会发生的社会动荡。

 **Summary:**
Iran's hardliners are experiencing internal strife following their loss to reformist president-elect Masoud Pezeshkian. The two main contenders, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Saeed Jalili, failed to unite behind a single candidate as they had in previous elections. This division has led to recriminations between the hardliners' factions over their mishandling of the economy and power struggles among them.

The hardline grouping is composed of social conservatives who oppose rapprochement with the US, but Ghalibaf was seen as the regime's preferred candidate in the election. However, Pezeshkian's unexpected entry into the race led to his victory. Accusations have been made between Jalili and Ghalibaf regarding their campaign strategies and alleged misconduct during the elections.

Pezeshkian has promised reforms such as easing restrictions on social media, ending patrols by morality police, and seeking relief from US sanctions through resolving the nuclear stand-off with the West. However, hardliners argue that Pezeshkian cannot change significant policies shaped by Supreme Leader Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards.

Concerns remain about Iran's nuclear program and military cooperation with Russia, as well as potential social unrest if reformists perceive limited options for changing the country's direction due to hardliners' pressure on Pezeshkian's government.
