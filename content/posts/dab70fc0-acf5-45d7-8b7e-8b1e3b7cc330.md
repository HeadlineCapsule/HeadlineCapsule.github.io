华纳兄弟发现公司面临最后期限，NBA转播权悬而未决

**摘要：** Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) 面临着一项关键决定，涉及其未来美国国家篮球协会 (NBA) 的广播权利。该公司直到周一晚上才能与迪士尼、亚马逊 Prime Video 和康卡斯特的 NBC 的竞争对手竞标相匹配，以获得下一轮 NBA 广播权利。这些权利的价值预计将增加一倍多，达到约 750 亿美元，为期 11 年。

WBD 的当前合同允许它有机会与亚马逊和 NBC 的第三方报价相匹配。谈判已成为对未来体育版权公投，随着媒体格局的变化，WBD 可能失去其核心的现场体育节目。由于平均每年支付的金额更接近，WBD 更有可能瞄准亚马逊的提议。

最终结果取决于 WBD 是否匹配任何报价，因为这不是一个竞价战争。 NBA 专员强调，美元金额将不会是评估谁会获胜的唯一标准。全球影响力和粉丝服务也是考虑因素。

讨论对 WBD 来说是一个关键时刻，该公司一直在考虑由于 390 亿美元的净债务和不断下落的市值而可能拆分公司。权利包的总价值翻了一番，反映了现场体育在留住有线电视和流媒体订阅者方面的作用。

**要点：**
- Warner Bros Discovery 必须在周一晚上之前匹配竞争对手对价值约 750 亿美元的 11 年 NBA 广播权利的竞标。
- 谈判是对未来体育版权的公投，WBD 可能失去其核心编程。
- WBD 更有可能瞄准与目前支付的金额更接近的亚马逊的提议。
- NBA 专员亚当·西尔弗 (Adam Silver) 强调，全球影响力和粉丝服务也是评估标准，而不仅仅是美元金额。
- 讨论对面临拆分公司压力的 WBD 来说是一个关键时刻。

 **Summary:** Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) faces a critical decision regarding its future broadcast rights to the US National Basketball Association (NBA). The company has until Monday evening to match rival bids from Disney, Amazon Prime Video, and Comcast's NBC for the next round of NBA broadcast rights. These rights are set to more than double in value to roughly $7amoeba billion over 11 years.

WBD's current contract allows it a chance to match third-party offers from Amazon and NBC. The negotiations have become a referendum on the future of live sports rights, with WBD at risk of losing its cornerstone live sports programming amid changes in the broader media landscape. It is more likely that WBD will target Amazon's proposal due to the closer average annual value compared to what it currently pays.

The final outcome depends on WBD's response and whether they match one of the offers or not, as this is not a bidding war. The NBA commissioner emphasized that dollar figures would not be the only criterion evaluated for determining who will prevail in these negotiations. Factors such as reach globally and fan services are also considered.

The discussions come at a critical time for WBD, which has been contemplating a potential break-up of the company due to its $39 billion net debt load and falling market capitalization. The overall value of the rights package is set to double, reflecting the importance of live sports in retaining cable and streaming subscribers.
