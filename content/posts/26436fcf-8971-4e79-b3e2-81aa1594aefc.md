欧盟计划在2027年缩短贸易结算时间

# 欧盟计划在2027年缩短贸易结算时间

欧盟（EU）正在计划对其金融市场进行重大改革，将贸易结算时间缩短至与英国和美国的时间表一致。此举是在欧洲证券市场管理局（European Securities and Markets Authority）进行行业咨询后做出的决定，咨询结果显示70%的参与者支持在2027年第四季度或2028年初和年末减少结算时间。

结算是指匹配买卖双方并合法转移资产的过程。目前，除了北美、印度和现在欧盟之外，结算通常在T+2（交易后第2天）进行。美国在今年5月缩短了结算窗口，旨在实现市场现代化、增加流动性并降低失败交易的风险。

缩短贸易结算时间受到以下因素的影响：
- 新冠肺炎疫情期间美国的**股市狂热**暴露了T+2结算窗口的问题，当时像Robinhood这样的经纪商难以应对巨大的交易量。
- 美国、加拿大和墨西哥已经从T+2过渡到T+1（交易后第1天）的股票、债券和交易所交易基金结算。
- 英国正在探索在2027年年底前采用T+1结算。
- 印度去年缩短了结算时间。

欧洲委员会高级官员Sebastijan Hrovatin认为，欧盟在2027年底过渡是“现实的”。由于与其他地区相比，欧洲的资本市场更加分散，因此向T+1过渡可能更加复杂。然而，来自瑞士SIX交易所的Jesús Benito认为这一目标是可以实现的，并强调了欧盟、瑞士和英国在结算时间上保持统一的重要性。

预计这一转变将带来各种益处，包括提高市场效率、降低失败交易的风险以及改善欧洲金融市场的流动性。

 **EU Plans Move to Shorter Trade Settlement Times in 202n7**

The European Union (EU) is planning a significant change in its financial markets by reducing trade settlement times to align with the UK's timetable and the US, which made the transition earlier this year. This move comes after an industry consultation run by the **European Securities and Markets Authority**, where 70% of participants favored a reduction in the final quarter of 2027 or at the start and end of 2028.

Settlement is the process of matching and legally transferring assets from sellers to buyers. Currently, outside North America, India, and now the EU, it typically takes place over two days (T+2). The US shortened its settlement window in May as part of an effort to modernize markets, increase liquidity, and minimize failed trades' risk.

The move towards shorter trade settlement times has been influenced by various factors:
- **US meme stock mania** during the coronavirus pandemic highlighted issues with two-day settlement windows when brokers like Robinhood struggled to keep up with trading volumes.
- The US, Canada, and Mexico have already transitioned from T+2 to one-day (T+1) settlement for stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds.
- **UK** is exploring a move to one-day settlement by the end of 2027.
- India reduced its settlement time last year.

Sebastijan Hrovatin, a senior official at the European Commission, believes that late 2027 for the EU's transition is "realistic." The move to T+1 in Europe may be more complicated due to fragmented capital markets compared to other regions. However, Jesús Benito from Switzerland’s SIX exchange considers the target achievable and emphasizes the importance of unity between the **EU**, Switzerland, and the UK on settlement timing.

The transition is expected to bring benefits such as increased market efficiency, reduced risk of failed trades, and improved liquidity in financial markets across Europe.
