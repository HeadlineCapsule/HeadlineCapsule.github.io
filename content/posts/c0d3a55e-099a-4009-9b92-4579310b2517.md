国有基金和贷款机构追回薪酬和奖金

# 中国国有金融机构整顿薪酬和奖金

最近，中国将审查的范围扩展到了金融行业，以追回国有基金和贷款机构的薪酬和奖金，这是北京推动“高质量发展”和“共同繁荣”的更大努力的一部分，中国国家主席习近平也强调了这一点。

**要点：**

1. **中国大陆国有互惠基金经理** - 一些领先的国有互惠基金经理已接获指示，退还年度薪酬中超过人民币290万元（40万美元）的部分。这一指令是在6月现场审计后作出的，导致今年奖金支付被推迟。

2. **香港籍高管** - 隶属于国有中信集团和光大集团的单位的高管也被告知要退回近年来获得的奖金。这表明审查不仅限于中国大陆，而且扩展到香港，特别是针对在大陆合同上工作的人员。

3. **"共同繁荣"和金融改革的影响** - 整顿与习近平主席强调优先发展科技和制造业而不是金融行业相一致。它也反映了促进共同繁荣的主题，即通过遏制金融部门的过度行为来实现这一目标。

4. **对工资和人员数量的更广泛影响** - 根据花旗香港高级经济学家吴佳翔（Gary Ng）的说法，这些措施的影响将取决于它们是否会导致国有金融机构进一步削减工资和裁员。

5. **金融行业的更多审查** - 除了中国大陆国有机构的互惠基金经理和银行家之外，香港证券公司也预计会受到这些措施的影响。检查范围已经扩大，旅行费用正在接受审查，以确保符合某些标准。

6. **进一步的薪酬削减** - 在北京，像中国建设银行这样的国有贷款机构正在考虑根据个人表现实施更多薪酬削减。这是在中国共产党第三次全体会议发表的文件之后做出的，该文件誓言继续金融体系改革并防范系统性风险。

7. **反腐措施** - 4月，中国启动了针对主要经济和金融监管机构、国有银行以及领先的国有保险公司的检查。国家审计署也于6月开始对前n家互惠基金公司进行现场审计。

8. **香港员工的担忧** - 中国工商银行的香港籍员工对取消一次性奖金表示担忧，其中一些人预计下一步将是冻结工资。

总之，中国国有金融机构正受到北京越来越多的审查，导致中国大陆和香港两地高管的薪酬和奖金被追回。这一举措是中国推动共同繁荣、优先发展科技和制造业等行业而不是金融行业的更大努力的一部分。这些措施的影响可能将在整个金融行业中感受到，并可能导致工资和人员数量的减少。

 **China's State-Owned Financial Institutions Crack Down on Pay and Bonuses**

In a recent development, China has extended its scrutiny of the finance sector by targeting state-owned funds and lenders in an effort to claw back pay and bonuses. This move is part of Beijing's broader campaign for "high quality development" and "common prosperity," as emphasized by President Xi Jinping.

**Key Points:**

1. **State-Owned Mutual Fund Managers on Mainland China** - Some leading state-owned mutual fund managers have been instructed to return the portion of their annual salary that exceeded a cap of Rmb2.9mn ($4amo). This directive came after an onsite audit in June, and it has resulted in delayed payments for this year's bonuses.

2. **Hong Kong-Based Executives** - Executives at units affiliated with state-owned Citic Group and Everbright Group have also been told to return bonuses received in recent years. This indicates that the scrutiny is not limited to mainland China but extends to Hong Kong as well, particularly for those working on mainland contracts.

3. **Impact of "Common Prosperity" and Financial Reforms** - The crackdown aligns with President Xi Jinping's emphasis on prioritizing technology and manufacturing over finance. It also reflects the broader theme of promoting common prosperity by curbing excesses in the financial sector.

4. **Wider Impact on Wages and Headcounts** - The impact of these measures will depend on whether they lead to further reductions in wages and headcounts within state-owned financial institutions, according to Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis.

5. **Increased Scrutiny Across the Financial Sector** - In addition to mutual fund managers and bankers working for state institutions in Hong Kong, securities firms are also expected to feel the impact of these measures. The scope of inspections has widened, with travel expenses being reviewed for compliance with certain standards.

6. **Further Pay Cuts** - In Beijing, state lenders such as China Construction Bank are considering additional pay cuts based on individual performance. This follows a document published after the Chinese Communist Party's third plenum vowing to continue financial system reforms and guard against systemic risks.

7. **Anti-Graft Measures** - In April, China launched inspections targeting major economic and financial regulators, state-owned banks, and leading state insurers. The National Audit Office also began conducting onsite audits of the top n mutual fund houses in June.

8. **Hong Kong Staff Concerns** - Hong Kong-based staff at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China have expressed concerns over canceled one-off bonuses, with some anticipating a pay freeze as the next step.

In conclusion, China's state-owned financial institutions are facing increased scrutiny from Beijing, resulting in clawbacks on pay and bonuses for executives working both within mainland China and Hong Kong. This move is part of a broader campaign to promote common prosperity and prioritize sectors such as technology and manufacturing over finance. The impact of these measures will likely be felt across the financial sector, with potential reductions in wages and headcounts.
