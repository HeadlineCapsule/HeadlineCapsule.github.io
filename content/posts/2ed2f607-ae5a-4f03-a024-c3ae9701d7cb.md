预计乔·拜登将专注于外交政策，以追求自己的政治遗产。

**乔·拜登的外交政策遗产：一个新时代**

随着美国总统乔·拜登退出2024年美国总统选举，他的政府正在将重点转移到巩固关键领域的外交政策成就上。在“跛脚鸭”总统任期内，拜登将在全球事务中不受政治约束地采取行动。

**要点：**

* **中东和乌克兰**：在唐纳德·特朗普总统任期内，这两个地区最有可能发生重大变化。
* **以色列总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡的访问**：拜登有一个机会通过结束以色列和哈马斯的战争来推动他的遗产。
* **副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯的单独会议**：她有机会加强她在世界舞台上的声誉，特别是在加沙冲突中。
* **俄罗斯、伊朗和中国的问题**：对手可能会利用这一过渡期，但拜登政府向美国盟友保证，他们对抵制独裁者和对手的努力不会改变。

**优先事项：**

* **确保对乌克兰的支持**：确保在特朗普获胜的情况下提供军事援助。
* **加快交付**：与乌克兰完成双边交易，并在拜登任期结束之前推动任何可用援助。
* **巩固声誉**：进行访问以吸引人们关注美国对乌克兰的援助，例如在基辅时美国F-16抵达。

**分析师观点：**

* **理查德·丰泰恩**：“你仍然是总司令……你仍然拥有美国的力量。”
* **丹尼斯·罗斯**：“这个政府在某些方面将更加自由地这样做，并且政府中的人们将更有使命感地完成这项工作，以表明他们能够做到这一点。”
* **理查德·哈斯**：“我实际上认为世界会认为拜登是一个比一周前更强大的跛脚鸭总统，至少在11月之前是这样。”

**遗产：**

拜登决定退出总统选举，促使一些外交官和外交政策专家担心对手可能会利用这一过渡期。然而，分析师表示，拜登可以通过专注于关键优先事项并进行访问来吸引人们关注美国对乌克兰的援助来巩固他的声誉。

**Joe Biden's Foreign Policy Legacy: A New Era**

As President Joe Biden drops out of the 2024 US presidential race, his administration is shifting its focus to solidifying foreign policy achievements in key areas. With a lame duck presidency, Biden will have more freedom to act on global affairs without political constraints.

**Key Points:**

* **Middle East and Ukraine**: The two areas most likely to shift dramatically under a Donald Trump presidency.
* **Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit**: A chance for Biden to advance his legacy by ending the war between Israel and Hamas.
* **Vice-President Kamala Harris' separate meeting**: An opportunity for her to bolster her reputation on the world stage, particularly in the conflict in Gaza.
* **Russia, Iran, and China concerns**: Adversaries may take advantage of the transition, but Biden's administration reassures US allies that nothing will change about their efforts to stand up to autocrats and adversaries.

**Priorities:**

* **Guaranteeing support for Ukraine**: Ensuring military aid is available in case of a Trump win.
* **Accelerating deliveries**: Completing bilateral deals with Ukraine and pushing any aid available before Biden's term ends.
* **Cementing reputation**: Making trips to draw attention to American assistance for Ukraine, such as being in Kyiv when US F-16s arrive.

**Analysts' Views:**

* **Richard Fontaine**: "You're still commander-in-chief...and you still have the power of the United States at your disposal."
* **Dennis Ross**: "This administration, in some ways, is going to be more free to do that, and the people in it are going to have even more of a sense of mission to get it accomplished as a way of showing what they were able to do."
* **Richard Haass**: "I actually think the world will see Biden as less of a lame duck president, at least between now and November, than they did a week ago."

**Legacy:**

Biden's decision to drop out of the presidential race has sparked fears among some diplomats and foreign policy experts that adversaries may take advantage of the transition. However, analysts say that Biden can still cement his reputation by focusing on key priorities and making trips to draw attention to American assistance for Ukraine.
