工党考虑禁止新北海许可证的管道

# 英国工党考虑禁止新北海许可证

英国政府，由工党领导，正在考虑禁止目前正在处理申请的公司的石油和天然气钻探新许可证。这一举措符合他们实现碳排放净零的目标，这是其去碳化计划的一部分。潜在的禁令超出了该行业一些人的预期，引起了工会和该部门对就业损失的担忧。

# 坎布里亚煤矿项目被工党政府撤回支持

除了考虑停止新北海钻探许可外，英国政府还撤回了对坎布里亚煤矿项目的支持，该项目在之前的保守党政府时期获得了批准。这一决定表明了工党致力于其绿色信誉和应对气候变化的承诺。

# 工党承诺停止发放新的石油和天然气许可证，而不是撤销现有许可证

在他们的选举活动中，工党承诺在实现碳排放净零的去碳化计划中，不会发放新的石油和天然气许可证，而允许现有许可证继续运营。对已经进展中的申请实施潜在禁令将超过该行业的预期，并可能导致工会担心就业损失而发生冲突。

# 北海石油工业对工党潜在禁令及风落税计划表示担忧

北海石油工业对正在进行的钻探申请的潜在禁令以及增加该部门风落税的计划表示担忧。这些措施可能会加速老化盆地的衰退，并影响该地区工人就业安全。

# 工党的宣言：向可再生能源转型

工党旨在停止在北海天然气和油田的所有新钻探许可证，这得到了他们迅速增加风能和太阳能的宣言支持。英国政府已经设定了临时目标，即到2030年实现电力生成碳排放净零，作为其向可再生能源转型的一部分。

# 工党在北海钻探和化石燃料使用上的立场受到批评

工党的北海上田立场受到化石燃料行业和工会（如联合工会和总工会）的批评，这些工会传统上支持该党。批评者认为，鉴于英国在向低碳经济转型时仍然依赖化石燃料，该政策在经济上站不住脚。

# 英国政府表达了应对气候变化的承诺

新工党政府已经采取措施表明其致力于应对气候变化，包括放宽英格兰 onshore风力涡轮机规划规则并招募气候变化委员会咨询机构的前首席执行官Chris Stark。能源安全部门强调，虽然不会发放探索新领域的新许可证，但现有石油和天然气许可证将不会被撤销，这标志着北海部门平衡转型。

 **UK Labour Party Considers Ban on New North Sea Licenses**  
The UK government, led by the Labour party, is contemplating a ban on new oil and gas drilling licenses from companies whose applications are currently being processed. This move aligns with their commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions as part of their decarbonization plans. The potential ban would go beyond what some in the industry had anticipated, raising concerns about job losses among unions and within the sector.

**Cumbrian Coal Mine Project Withdrawn Support by Labour Government**  
In addition to considering a halt on new North Sea drilling licenses, the UK government has withdrawn support for a Cumbria coal mine project that had been approved during the previous Conservative administration. This decision demonstrates the Labour party's dedication to its green credentials and commitment to tackling climate change.

**Labour Party Pledges to Stop Issuing New Oil & Gas Licenses, Not Revoke Existing Ones**  
During their election campaign, the Labour party pledged not to issue new oil and gas licenses while allowing existing ones to continue operations as part of their net-zero decarbonization plans. The potential ban on applications already in progress would exceed expectations within the industry and could lead to conflicts with unions concerned about job losses.

**Concerns Raised by North Sea Oil Industry Over Labour's Potential Ban & Windfall Tax Plans**  
The North Sea oil industry has expressed concerns over the potential ban on drilling applications already in progress, as well as plans to increase windfall taxes within the sector. These measures could accelerate the decline of an aging basin and impact job security for workers in the region.

**Labour's Manifesto: Transition Towards Renewable Energy Sources**  
The Labour party aims to cease all new licenses for drilling in North Sea gas and oilfields, focebacked by their manifesto commitment to rapidly increase wind and solar power. The UK government has set an interim goal of achieving net-zero emissions from electricity generation by 2030 as part of its transition towards renewable energy sources.

**Criticism Over Labour's Stance on North Sea Drilling & Fossil Fuels Usage**  
Labour's stance on the North Sea has faced criticism from both the fossil fuel industry and unions, such as Unite and GMB, which have traditionally supported the party. Critics argue that the policy does not make economic sense given the UK's continued reliance on fossil fuels even as it transitions to a low-carbon economy.

**UK Government Sends Message of Commitment to Tackling Climate Change**  
The new Labour administration has taken steps to demonstrate its commitment to addressing climate change, including easing planning rules for onshore wind turbines in England and recruiting Chris Stark, former chief executive of the Climate Change Committee advisory body. The energy security department emphasizes that while no new licenses will be issued for exploring new fields, existing oil and gas licenses will not be revoked, enscribing a balanced transition within the North Sea sector.
