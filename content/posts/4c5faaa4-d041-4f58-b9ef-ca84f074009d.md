美国干预刚果矿产出售给中国军工集团

**美国干预刚果矿产出售给中国军工集团**

美国总统特朗普政府介入了一项刚果铜矿的出售交易，该矿原计划被中国国有国防公司子公司北控收购。这一干预旨在防止北京增加对清洁能源基础设施所需关键矿产的控制。

美国官员鼓励刚果民主共和国国营采矿公司Gécamines重新考虑将Trafigura支持的Chemaf Resources出售给Norin Mining的交易。在西方国家和中国激烈竞争清洁能源基础设施所需重要金属的同时，这一举动也引起了人们的关注。

Chemaf从Gécamines租用了其旗舰项目Mutoshi的许可证，而Gécamines声称应该提前被告知交易情况。在通过媒体报道了解到交易情况后，Gécamines否决了交易，并指出在未经批准的情况下不能发生任何“直接或间接”的控制变化。

北控自称是中国军队武器和设备的主要供应商，已经在刚果东南部拥有两处铜钴矿。北控希望从Chemaf收购的资产包括两个生产矿山Mutoshi和Etoile以及可能拥有更多资源的其他采矿许可证。

钴和铜是军事装备的重要金属，因为它们被用于战斗机中的超合金以及电线和弹药中。联合国的一份报告发现，北控与其他中国公司一起，至少八次向刚果供应武器。美国财政部自2020年以来禁止美国公司或个人拥有北控的股份。

这次出售干预是美国努力改善对美方友善的公司获得金属的机会，因为美国和中国在控制清洁能源基础设施所需关键矿产方面竞争加剧。

 **US Intervenes in Congo Mine Sale to Chinese Arms Group**

The US government has intervened in the sale of a Congolese copper mine, which was set to be acquired by Norinco, a subsidiary of China's state-owned defense company. The intervention aimangs to prevent Beijing from increasing its control over critical minerals needed for clean energy infrastructure.

US officials encouraged Gécamines, the Democratic Republic of Congo’s state-owned miner, to review the sale of Trafigura-backed Chemaf Resources to Norin Mining. The move comes amid fierce competition between western countries and China over access to essential metals for clean energy infrastructure.

Chemaf leases the permit for its flagship project Mutoshi from Gécamines, which claimed that it should have been informed of the deal in advance. After learning about the sale through media reports, Gécamines vetoed the deal and stated that any change in "direct or indirect" control could not take place without its approval.

Norinco describes itself as a major supplier of Chinese Army weaponry and equipment and already has two other copper-cobalt mines in southeastern Congo. The assets Norinco hopes to acquire from Chemaf include two producing mines, Mutoshi and Etoile, and several other mining licenses that could hold further resources.

Cobalt and copper are vital metals for military equipment since they are used in superalloys for fighter jets, as well as wiring and munitions. A UN report found that Norinco had supplied arms to Congo at least eight times between amoongst other Chinese companies. The US Treasury has prohibited American companies or individuals from owning shares in Norinco since 2020.

The sale intervention is part of Washington's efforts to improve access to metals for US-friendly companies amid increasing competition with China over control of critical minerals needed for clean energy infrastructure.
