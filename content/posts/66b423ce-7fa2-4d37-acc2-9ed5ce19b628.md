中国拒绝了北约关于支持俄罗斯在乌克兰战争的说法。

# 中国拒绝北约指控

北京指责北约散布“谎言和诽谤”，此前北约声称中国已成为俄罗斯对乌克兰战争中的“决定性支持者”。中国政府要求北约远离亚洲，警告其保持在北大西洋地区区域防御组织的作用。

## 北约的指控和中国回应

北约领导人在其华盛顿年度峰会上呼吁中国停止对俄罗斯战争的所有物质和政治支持，这是北约对北京的最强烈谴责。作为回应，中国批评这些指控是具有挑衅性的，并包含明显的谎言和诽谤。

## 中国对贸易流动和军事行动的立场

中国驻欧盟使团表示，中国寻求乌克兰冲突的政治解决方案，并否认向冲突双方提供致命武器。北京还强调了其与俄罗斯的“正常贸易流动”不应受到干扰或胁迫，同时反驳了北约的指控，警告联盟不要干涉亚太事务。

## 该地区日益增长的军事存在和演习

随着中国继续展示其不断增长的实力——在台湾附近进行创纪录的空中行动和在菲律宾附近进行海军演习——美国盟友日本和韩国增加了联合规划、演习和武器部署。北约成员英国、法国、加拿大和德国也加大了亚太地区的军事行动和安全合作。

## 中国对解放军日益增长的区域实力的回应

北京抵制了美国加强该地区与盟国关系的努力，谴责这是建立“亚洲北约”的阴谋。中国政府认为这些行动是破坏性的，具有霸权主义色彩。

总之，中国拒绝了北约支持俄罗斯在乌克兰战争中的指控，要求联盟远离亚太地区事务，同时通过在该地区增加自身军事存在和演习来做出回应。

 **China rejects NATO accusations**: Beijing has accused Nato of smearing the country with "lies and smears" after the alliance claimed that China had become a "decisive enabler" of Russia's war against Ukraine. The Chinese government demanded that Nato stay out of Asia, warning it to remain within its role as a regional defensive organization in the North Atlantic.

**NATO's accusations and response from China**: NATO leaders have called on China to cease all material and political support for Russia's war effort against Ukraine during their annual summit in Washington, marking the strongest-ever condemnation of Beijing by the alliance. In response, China has criticized these accusations as provocative with obvious lies and smears.

**China's stance on trade flows and military operations**: The Chinese mission to the EU stated that China seeks a political settlement for the conflict in Ukraine and denies providing lethal weapons to either party involved. Beijing also emphasized its "normal trade flows" with Russia should not be disrupted or coerced, while countering NATO's accusations by warning the alliance against interfering in Asia-Pacific affairs.

**Increased military presence and exercises in the region**: As China continues to demonstrate its growing clout through record numbers of air operations near Taiwan and naval drills near the Philippines, US allies such as Japan and South Korea have increased joint planning, exercises, and weapons deployments. NATO members like Britain, France, Canada, and Germany have also ramped up military operations and security cooperation in Asia-Pacific.

**China's response to the growing regional power of PLA**: Beijing has pushed back against US efforts to strengthen ties with its allies in the region by denouncing them as a plot to create an "Asian NATO." The Chinese government views these actions as disruptive and hegemonic.

In summary, China rejects NATO'amoor accusations of supporting Russia's war in Ukraine, demanding that the alliance stay out of Asia-Pacific affairs while countering with its own military presence and exercises in the region.
