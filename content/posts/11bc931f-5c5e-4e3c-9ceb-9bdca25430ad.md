特朗普警告美联储主席不要在选举前降息

唐纳德·特朗普警告美国联储主席杰伊·鲍威尔不要在11月总统大选之前削减利率。然而，如果当选，特朗普表示，只要鲍威尔“做正确的事情”，他就会允许鲍威尔完成他在央行的任期。共和党提名人承认联邦储备可能降息，但对在11月5日选举之前采取这种行动表示担忧。

人们担心特朗普意图将美联储政治化，包括试图在鲍威尔的任期结束于2026年之前将其赶下台。作为回应，特朗普表示，如果他相信鲍威尔正在为经济做出正确的决定，他就会让鲍威尔任职。

鲍威尔表示，他越来越有信心通货膨胀将回到联邦储备的**2%**目标，并暗示在选举前六周的9月份可能降息。特朗普批评了总统乔·拜登的经济问题，例如由于新冠疫情造成的供应链中断而导致的通货膨胀上升以及俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后能源成本飙升。

尽管在2018年提名鲍威尔，但特朗普此前曾攻击他没有在贸易战中降低利率。在鲍威尔的任期结束之前推动替换他的努力可能面临法律挑战，与央行的对抗，以及市场波动的风险。正如鲍威尔所强调的那样，联邦储备的政治独立性对管理美国经济至关重要，他表示决定仅基于经济健康状况，而不是政治因素。

 **Donald Trump warns US Fed chair Jay Powell** against cutting interest rates before November's presidential election. However, if elected, Trump stated that he would allow Powell to finish his term at the central bank provided he is "doing the right thing." The Republican nominee acknowledged a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve but expressed concern over such action being taken prior to the election on November 5th.

**Financial market concerns** have arisen regarding Trump's intentions of politicizing the Fed, including attempts to force Powell out before his term ends in 2026. In response, Trump stated that he would let Powell serve if he believed the chair was making appropriate decisions for the economy.

Powell has indicated growing confidence that inflation is returning to the Federal Reserve's target of **2%** and hinted at a possible rate cut in September, just six weeks before the election. Trump has criticized President Joe Biden over economic issues such as rising inflation due to supply chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and energy costs surging after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Despite nominating Powell in 2amo, Trump previously attacked him for not lowering interest rates during his trade wars. A push to replace Powler before the end of his term could face legal challenges, a stand-off with the central bank, and risk significant market volatility. The Federal Reserve's political independence is crucial in managing the US economy, as emphasized by Powell, who stated that decisions are based solely on economic health rather than political factors.
