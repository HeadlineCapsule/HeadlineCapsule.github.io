房屋开发商警告说，建筑业滞后威胁到工党“让英国建设”的计划

英国房建商警告称，至少需要一年时间才能开始增加住房供应。巴瑞特和MJ格利森等开发商预计今年建成房屋数量减少，原因包括市场低迷、土地购买放缓和新工地开工延迟。政府提出的在五年内建造150万套房屋的目标面临挑战，因为商业房建商的产量恢复时间表被推迟到了2025年。

关键点：
- 英国房建商预计需要一年时间才能增加住房供应，巴瑞特和MJ格利森等开发商预计今年建成房屋数量减少，原因包括市场低迷和土地购买及工地开工延迟。
- 政府提出的在五年内建造150万套房屋的目标依赖于商业房建商的交付，但产量恢复时间表已被推迟到2025年。
- 投资公司Aynsley Lammin表示，最初预计行业产量可能从2024年开始恢复，“绝对被推迟到了2025年”，从2025年第二季度开始，预计将出现有意义的产量增长。
- 政府（在基尔·斯塔默爵士的领导下）宣布了措施，以解封英国的规划系统并促进每年建造超过300,000套房屋——一个近半个世纪以来没有实现的目标。然而，由于完成量预计今年将下降，满足这一目标仍然存在挑战。
- 随着恢复进程加快，重新建立交付更多房屋所需熟练劳动力也可能成为制约恢复的因素。

 **Summary:**  
UK housebuilders have warned that it will take at least a year for them to start increasing housing supply. Barratt and MJ Gleeson are among the developers expecting fewer homes built this year due to market slumps, land buying slowdowns, and new site openings delays. The government's target of building 1.5 million homes over five years faces challenges as commercial housebuilders struggle with output recovery timelines pushed into 2025.

**Key Points:**  
- UK housebuilders anticipate a year before increasing housing supply, with Barratt and MJ Gleeson expecting fewer home completions this year due to market slumps and delays in land buying and site openings.
- The government's target of building 1.cuarto million homes over five years is dependent on commercial housebuilders delivering more homes, but output recovery timelines have been pushed into 2025.
- Aynsley Lammin from Investec stated that the industry's output might start to recover in 2024 has "definitely been pushed into 2025," with meaningful volume increases expected from Q2 of 2025.
- The government, under Sir Keir Starmer's administration, announced measures to unclog Britain's planning system and boost housebuilding to more than 300,000 homes a year - a target not met for almost half a century. However, challenges remain in meeting this goal as completions are projected to fall this year.
- Rebuilding the skilled workforce necessary for delivering many more homes could also prove a brake on recovery as it gathers pace.
