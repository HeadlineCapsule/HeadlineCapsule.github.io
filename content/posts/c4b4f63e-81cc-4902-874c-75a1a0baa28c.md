巴菲特大幅削减美国基金上市募资目标，最高降幅达90%

**比尔·阿克曼将美国基金 IPO 目标削减了多达 90%** 

- 比尔·阿克曼（Bill Ackman）大幅降低了 Pershing Square USA 初次公开募股（IPO）的筹资目标，旨在筹集 25 亿美元至 40 亿美元资金，根据营销工作情况，该金额可能增加到 100 亿美元。这比最初的 250 亿美元目标减少了很多。
- 这位亿万富翁对冲基金经理强调，美国零售投资者将在 IPO 的成功中发挥重要作用，并预计他们将成为“后市需求的巨大来源”。
- Pershing Square USA 已从著名的机构投资者那里获得了订单，包括总部位于波士顿的 Baupost Group 和德克萨斯州教师退休系统。一家管理超过 650 亿美元资产的家庭办公室表示有兴趣购买该交易近 10% 的份额。
- 该基金的 IPO 预计将是一家在纽约证券交易所上市的封闭式基金，专注于 Pershing Square USA 认为被低估的大市值上市公司股票。阿克曼预计该公司将比其净资产高溢价交易。
- 投资者对可能出现的折扣和与比尔·阿克曼作为基金关键决策者的“关键人物风险”提出了担忧。

 **Bill Ackman Slashes US Fund IPO Target by Up to 90%**  

- Bill Ackman has significantly reduced his fundraising target for Pershing Square USA's initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise between $2.5bn and $4bn, which could potentially increase up to $1ebn depending on marketing efforts. This is a drastic reduction from the original goal of $25bn.
- The billionaire hedge fund manager emphasized that US retail investors would play an essential role in the IPO's success and anticipated them as a "huge source of aftermarket demand."
- Pershing Square USA has received orders from notable institutional investors, including Boston-based Baupost Group and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas. A family office with over $65bn in assets expressed interest in purchasing nearly 10% of the deal.
- The fund's IPO is expected to be a closed-end fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange, focusing on large publicly traded stocks that Pershing Square USA believes are undervalued. Ackman expects the company to trade at a premium compared with its net assets.
- Concerns have been raised by investors regarding potential discount emergence and key man risk associated with Bill Ackman's role as a crucial decision maker in the fund.
