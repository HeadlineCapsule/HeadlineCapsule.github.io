油价上涨，因为驾车旺季已经开始

# 油价上涨至两个月以来的最高水平

**文章摘要：** 油价上涨至两个月以来的最高水平，自6月初以来，布伦特原油上涨了约10美元/桶。这一增长归因于驾车出行旺季的到来、美国库存减少以及中东地区紧张局势加剧。

**要点：**
- **布伦特原油** 最高达到86.92美元/桶，而西德克萨斯中质原油上涨至83.53美元/桶，随后回落。
- 与前一周相比，美国商业原油库存减少1220万桶，因为为满足夏季出行需求，炼油厂的产量增加。目前，库存量比同期五年平均水平低约4%。
- 过去四周内，美国石油进口量增长9%，汽油库存周环比减少220万桶，预计未来几周需求将强劲增长。
- 由于中东地区夏季高温导致原油被用于发电，欧佩克+出口量大幅下降，尤其是海湾国家和伊拉克，从而导致供应紧张。
- 6月初，在欧佩克+成员宣布计划从9月开始逐步恢复220万桶/天的产量后，油价下跌，但此后一直稳步上涨。
- 推动价格上涨的其他因素包括对以色列和真主党之间冲突升级的担忧，以及交易员预测如果油价突破每桶90美元关口，油价将继续上涨。然而，对飓风贝丽尔造成的干扰担忧已经减弱。

**结论：** 驾车出行旺季的需求、美国库存减少以及中东地区地缘政治紧张局势的结合，导致油价上涨，布伦特原油达到6月初以来的最高水平。

 **Article Summary:** Oil prices have rallied to a two-month high as Brent crude rose by approximately $10 per barrel since early June. This increase is attributed to the onset of peak driving season, dwindling US stockpiles, and renewed tensions in the Middle East.

**Key Points:**
- **Brent crude** reached as high as $86.92 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate advanced to $83.53 before slipping back.
- US commercial inventories of crude oil fell by 12.2 million barrels compared with the previous week due to increased refinery production for summer travel demand. Inventories are now about 4% lower than the five-year average at this time of year.
- The US has seen a 9% increase in oil imports over the past four weeks, and gasoline inventories fell by 2.n million barrels week on week, with demand expected to rise strongly in the coming weeks.
- Supplies have tightened due to Opec+ exports being sharply lower, particularly from Gulf countries and Iraq, as a result of increased crude burn for power amidst summer heatwaves in the Middle East.
- The price of oil fell at the beginning of June after members of Opec+ announced plans to gradually reintroduce 2.2 million barrels of cut production back into the market starting from September, but has since steadily rallied.
- Other factors contributing to rising prices include concerns over potential escalation in conflict between Israel and Hizbollah, as well as traders betting on oil rising further if it breaks through the $90-a-barrel mark. However, fears of disruption from Hurricane Beryl have receded.

**Conclusion:** The combination of peak driving season demand, dwindling US stockpiles, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East has led to a rally in oil prices, with Brent crude reaching its highest level since early June.
