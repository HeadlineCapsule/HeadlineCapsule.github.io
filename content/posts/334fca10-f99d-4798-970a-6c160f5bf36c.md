黑石公司收购“循环”私募股权信贷风险

# 摘要

黑石集团已成为风险转移产品的最大买家之一，尤其是那些以私募股权基金经理使用的短期贷款为后盾的产品。这些产品被称为**重大风险转移**（SRT），可以帮助贷款人减少监管资本要求并提高回报。黑石投资了由订阅行支持的金额转移，由于没有历史损失，这种贷款类型被认为是安全的。

如果投资者未能或拒绝履行其承诺，则私募股权行业对这些交易产生的风险的敞口可能会扩大。黑石表示，SRT的风险仅占其投资组合余额的“个位数百分比”，并强调订阅行在过去30-40年里从未出现过违约情况。

这些产品的市场是在2008年金融危机之后发展的，当时贷款人需要满足更严格的监管资本要求。国际信贷投资组合管理人员协会估计，去年全球有89笔SRT交易，其中大约80%是企业贷款，其余部分包括订阅行、汽车贷款和贸易融资贷款。

尽管黑石面临着大型投资者拒绝资本调用或面临制裁或欺诈等复杂情况的风险，但他们认为自己对SRT的参与是负责任的。然而，人们仍然担心可能出现不可预见的事件链，以及出售这些产品的银行是否已经充分保护自己免受全球金融危机期间所经历的类似风险的影响。

## 关键点：

- 黑石集团是重大风险转移（SRT）等风险转移产品的主要购买者。
- SRT由私募股权基金经理使用的短期贷款支持，订阅行因其安全性而最受欢迎。
- 这些产品的市场是在2008年金融危机之后发展的，在最近几年有所增长。
- 黑石对SRT的风险敞口有限，但并非完全消除。
- 人们仍然担心可能出现不可预见的事件链，以及银行是否已经充分保护自己。

 **Summary of Article:**

Blackstone Group has emerged as one of the largest buyers of risk transfer products, specifically those underpinned by short-term loans used by private equity fund managers. These products are known as significant risk transfers (SRTs), which allow lenders to reduce regulatory capital requirements and increase returns. Blackstone has invested in SRTs backed by subscription lines, a type of loan that is considered safe due to its lack of historical losses.

The private equity industry's exposure to risks generated by these transactions can be magnified if an investor fails or refuses to fund their commitment. Blackstone has stated that the risk from SRTs constitutes only a "single-digit percentage" of their portfolebalance and emphasizes the safety of subscription lines, which have never experienced defaults in the past 30-40 years.

The market for these products developed after the 2008 financial crisis when lenders were required to meet more stringent regulatory capital requirements. The International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers estimates that there were 89 SRT transactions globally last year, with approximately 80% being corporate loans and the rest comprising subscription lines, car loans, and trade finance loans.

While Blackstone is exposed to risks associated with large investors refusing capital calls or facing complications such as sanctions or fraud, they maintain that their involvement in SRTs has been responsible. However, concerns remain about the potential for unforeseen chains of events and whether banks selling these products have fully protected themselves from risks similar to those experienced during the global financial crisis.

**Key Points:**

- Blackstone Group is a major buyer of risk transfer products known as significant risk transfers (SRTs).
- SRTs are backed by short-term loans used by private equity fund managers, with subscription lines being the most popular type due to their safety.
- The market for these products developed after the 2008 financial crisis and has grown in recent years.
- Blackstone's exposure to risks from SRTs is limited but not entirely eliminated.
- Concerns remain about potential unforeseen chains of events and whether banks selling these products have fully protected themselves.
