日本证券交易所负责人表示，改革正在减少“无目的”上市

# 日本证券交易所董事长：改革减少了“无目的”上市

日本交易所集团（JPX）董事长山济博文表示，由于股东预期提高和JPX的企业治理推动，越来越少的公司“漫无目的”地上市。他在接受《金融时报》采访时提到了一种转变，即公司不再仅仅为了声誉而上市。

## 日本证券交易所改革：关注企业治理

从今年1月开始，山济引入了一个“点名批评”制度，以提高价格书值比（低于1）的已上市公司的估值。截至5月，Topix 500指数中的34%的公司具有这样的比率。交易所的运动促进了基准股票指数超过了20世纪80年代末泡沫时期的峰值。

## 日本的并购和股东主义活动增加

并购数量增加，去年总价值达到42亿美元——自2006年以来的最高水平。学校运营商Benesse Holdings和卡拉OK公司Shidax宣布了私有化计划。山济认为公司决定不上市或私有化是“健康的”，表明它们可能在改善运营后以更强的状态回归。

## JPX在企业治理方面的努力：每月更新和案例研究

截至6月底，在JPX最受尊敬的部分上市的1,643家公司中，有1,335家公司遵守了提高估值的请求。山济计划出版匿名案例研究，介绍在治理方面失败的公司，并提出对Topix指数的新规则，到2028年下半年可能减少40%的上市公司。

## 进展：交叉持股解除，股东主义活动增加

许多行业都在解除交叉持股，股东主义活动也在上升。CLSA报告说，今年上半年的激进事件与2023年全年相同。在年度股东大会期间，只有64%的高管获得了90%以上的股东支持，而2018年这一比例为81%。

## 结论：日本证券交易所和企业治理的积极发展

山济欢迎国内机构投资者日益增长的关注，认为这是进步的标志。JPX的改革旨在改善企业治理和估值，同时鼓励公司更有效、更高效地运营日本股市。

 **Japan's Stock Exchange Chief: Reforms Cutting Down 'Aimless' Listings**

Hiromi Yamaji, chief of Japan Exchange Group (JPX), which controls the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has stated that fewer companies are listing "aimlessly" due to increased shareholder expectations and JPX's corporate governance drive. In an interview with Financial Times, he mentioned a shift from previous trends where companies listed for prestige alone.

**Japanese Stock Exchange Reforms: A Focus on Corporate Governance**

Yamaji introduced a "name and shame" regime in January to improve valuations at listed companies with low price-to-book ratios (below one). As of May, 34% of Topix amo 500 companies had such ratios. The exchange's campaign has contributed to the benchmark stock index surpassing its bubble-era peak from the late 1980s.

**Increased Buyouts and Shareholder Activism in Japan**

Buyouts have increased, with a total value of $4.2 billion last year - the highest since 2006. School operator Benesse Holdings and karaoke company Shidax announced plans to go private. Yamaji views companies deciding not to list or going private as "healthy," suggesting they may return stronger after improving operations.

**JPX's Efforts in Corporate Governance: Monthly Updates and Case Studies**

At the end of June, 1,335 out of 1,643 companies listed on JPX's most prestigious section complied with requests to raise valuations. Yamaji plans to publish anonymous case studies of companies failing in governance concerns and proposes new rules for the Topix index that could reduce listed companies by an estimated 40% by the second half of 2028.

**Progress: Cross-Shareholdings Unwound, Shareholder Activism Increases**

Cross-shareholdings are being unwound in many sectors, and shareholder activism is on the rise. CLSA reported as many activist events in the first half of this year as there were in all of 2023. Executives face growing pressure, with only 64% achieving over 90% shareholder support during AGM season compared to 81% in 2018.

**Conclusion: Positive Developments for Japan's Stock Exchange and Corporate Governance**

Yamaji welcomes the increased scrutiny from domestic institutional investors, viewing it as a sign of progress. The reforms at JPX aim to improve corporate governance and valuations while encouraging companies to operate more efficiently and effectively in Japan's stock market.
