投资者称唐纳德·特朗普的贬值美元计划不太可能成功

**摘要：**
投资者认为，如果唐纳德·特朗普在即将到来的选举中获胜并实现其削弱美元的计划，这一前景“极其不可能”发生，因为关税和减税等相冲突的政策。策略师警告称，较弱的美元将是短暂的，可能会导致更高的通货膨胀和利率。自2021年1月乔·拜登总统上任以来，美国贸易逆差有所增加，但美国经济仍因高利率而强劲。

**要点：**
- 投资者认为，特朗普削弱美元以促进制造业并减少贸易逆差的计划不太可能实现，因为关税和减税等相冲突的政策。
- 较弱的美元可能会导致更高的通货膨胀、利率以及全球经济风险，包括报复性关税。
- 美国经济在最近美元价值下跌的情况下仍保持强劲，高利率是关键因素。
- 特朗普削弱美元的其他选择因潜在的市场动荡和干扰成本而受到限制，干预的可能性不大。
- 共和党承诺维持美元的世界储备货币地位。

 **Summary:**  
Investors believe that Donald Trump's plan for devaluing the U.S. dollar, if he wins the upcoming election, is "extremely unlikely" due to conflicting policies such as tariffs and tax cuts. Strategists warn that a weaker dollar would be short-lived and could lead to higher inflation and interest rates. The US trade deficit has increased since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, but the U.S. economy remains strong with high interest rates.

**Key Points:**  
- Trump's plan for a weaker dollar to boost manufacturing and lower the trade deficit is seen as unlikely by investors due to conflicting policies like tariffs on imports and tax cuts.
- A weaker dollar could lead to higher inflation, interest rates, and global economic risks from retaliatory tariffs.
- The U.S. economy remains strong with high interest rates despite a recent dip in the value of the dollar.
- Trump's other options for devaluing the dollar are limited by potential market upheaval and disruption costs, making intervention unlikely.
- The US dollar is expected to remain the world's reserve currency as per Republican Party pledges.
