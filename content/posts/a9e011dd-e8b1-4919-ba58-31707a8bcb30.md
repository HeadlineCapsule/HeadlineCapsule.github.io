伯尼·桑德斯支持拜登，左翼提供党内叛乱的防线

**伯尼·桑德斯支持拜登连任**

进步民主党人伯尼·桑德斯公开支持乔·拜登连任，在温和派呼吁他退出竞选之际提供了至关重要的支持。在民主党内部面临挑战、共同对抗唐纳德·特朗普的竞选活动中，这种支持是进步派团结的重要表现。

在几位民主党议员敦促拜登在上个月与特朗普的辩论中表现不佳后退出竞选之后，桑德斯做出了这一认可。尽管如此，桑德斯表达了信心，认为有效的竞选活动将导致拜登总统在选举中决定性地击败特朗普。

鉴于他们曾在 2020 年民主党初选中相互竞争，以及之前在 2016 年挑战希拉里·克林顿时所面临的挑战，来自桑德斯的支持意义重大。作为左翼政治中最有影响力的人物之一，他的认可在党内具有分量。

虽然许多主流民主党人对拜登的政治前景保持沉默或不置可否，但桑德斯和其他进步派人物，如亚历山大·奥卡西奥-科尔特斯、阿亚娜·普雷斯利和伊尔汉·奥马尔，尽管有保留意见，但仍团结在拜登身边。在民主党准备迎接即将到来的选举、对抗唐纳德·特朗普时，这种团结至关重要。

在纳托峰会后的新闻发布会上，拜登试图消除人们对他的候选资格的疑虑，他在底特律发表了一场充满活力的演讲，强调了他对劳动人民的承诺以及与桑德斯所青睐的民粹主义经济政策一致的经济政策。随着共和党全国代表大会的临近，所有目光都将聚焦在拜登身上，以寻找他继续对抗特朗普的竞选活动中的决心和精力。

 **Bernie Sanders Supports Biden's Re-Election**  

Progressive Democrat Bernie Sanders has publicly endorsed Joe Biden for re-election, providing crucial support amidst calls from moderates to withdraw his candidacy. This backing is a significant show of unity on the progressive side of the Democratic Party as they face internal challenges in their campaign against Donald Trump.

Sanders' endorsement comes after several lawmakers within Biden's own party have urged him to quit the race following his poor performance in a debate with Trump last month. Despite this, Sanders has expressed confidence that an effective campaign will lead to a decisive victory for President Biden over Trump.

The support from Sanders is notable given their history as rivals during the 2020 Democratic primary and previous challenges against Hillary Clinton in 2016. As one of the most influential left-wing politicians, his endorsement carries weight within the party.

While many mainstream Democrats have remained silent or noncommittal about Biden's political future, Sanders and other progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar have rallied behind him despite their reservations. This unity is crucial as the Democratic Party faces internal divisions while preparing for the upcoming election against Donald Trump.

As Biden seeks to address doubts about his candidacy during a press conference following the Nato summit, he has also delivered an energetic speech in Detroit emphasizing his commitment to working people and populist economic policies that align with Sanders' preferred stances. With the Republican convention approaching, all eyes will be on Biden for signs of determination and mental acuity as he continues his campaign against Trump.
