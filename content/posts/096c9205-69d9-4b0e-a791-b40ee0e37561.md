特瑞·史密斯为不投资美国科技股英伟达辩护

**投资经理特里·史密斯（Terry Smith）**为自己将美国科技巨头英伟达排除在基金投资组合之外的决定进行辩护，因为该基金在今年上半年的表现低于基准。价值250亿英镑的Fundsmith Equity投资组合专注于增长型股票，持有苹果、Meta和微软等美国科技公司股份，但不包括英伟达。史密斯解释说，由于对英伟达前景预测不够令人信服，因此他的基金“没有持有任何英伟达股份”。

这一决定突显了基金经理所面临的挑战，他们避免投资于大型科技“超大市值”公司，而这些公司却主导着美国股市，因为它们占S&P指数增长部分的重要份额。英伟达、微软、亚马逊、Meta和苹果在上半年贡献了该指数14%增长的近60%。

Fundsmith Equity在6个月内收益9.3%，而MSCI世界指数上涨12.7%，S&P 500指数则上涨17%。史密斯承认，在当前的市场环境中，不持有像英伟达这样的AI股票可能会导致主动基金经理的表现不佳。

史密斯表现最佳的股票包括Novo Nordisk、Meta、微软、Alphabet和Stryker，而L’Oréal、Idexx、Nike、Brown-Forman和Waters则是该基金在该期间表现最差的股票之一。

 **Article Summary:** Investment manager Terry Smith defends his decision to exclude US technology giant Nvidia from his fund's portfolio after experiencing underperformance compared to its benchmark in the first half of the year. The Fundsmith Equity portfolio, focusing on growth stocks and valued at £25bn, includes stakes in major US tech companies such as Apple, Meta, and Microsoft but not Nvidia. Smith explained that his fund did "not own any Nvidia" due to unconvincing predictability of its outlook.

The decision highlighted the challenges faced by fund managers who avoid large technology "megacaps," which dominate the US stock market, as these companies account for a significant portion of the S&P 지표's growth. Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Apple contributed to almost 60% of the index's 14% increase in the first half of the year.

Fundsmith Equity returned 9.3% over six months, while the MSCI World Index gained 12.7%, and the S&P 500 index rose by 17%. Smith acknowledged that not owning AI stocks like Nvidia might lead to underperformance for active managers in the current market environment.

Smith's top-performing stocks included Novo Nordisk, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Stryker, while L’Oréal, Idexx, Nike, Brown-Forman, and Waters were among the fund's worst performers during this period.
