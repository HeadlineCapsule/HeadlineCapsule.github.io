优步和Lyft在加州零工经济案件中获胜

# 加州最高法院支持22号提案：共享经济公司的胜利

加州最高法院裁定支持优步和 Lyft 等共享经济巨头，维持 22 号提案，允许这些公司将工人归类为独立承包商而不是雇员。这一决定是对这些公司的重大胜利，也标志着劳工权利团体多年来试图推翻 22 号提案的法律挑战的结束。

## 要点：

1. **22 号提案**于 2020 年由加州选民通过，使共享经济公司免于一项州法律的约束，该法律将要求将其工人归类为雇员。相反，它为工人提供有限的医疗保健福利和最低收入保证。

2. 法院的裁决被视为优步和 Lyft 的重大胜利，他们在投票前积极运动支持 22 号提案。他们认为将司机视为雇员会对其商业模式造成生存威胁。

3. 优步和 DoorDash 等公司警告说，将工人重新归类为雇员可能会导致大量额外费用、乘客价格上涨以及由于工作时间灵活性丧失而导致的司机流失。

4. Jefferies 的分析师估计，到 2025 年，废除 22 号提案将对 Lyft、DoorDash 和优步造成可观的成本：分别约 3 亿美元、10 亿美元和 11 亿美元。这些公司可以通过提高费用来抵消其中约 85% 的额外费用，但这可能会减少需求。

## 结论
加州最高法院决定支持 22 号提案，确保共享经济工人将继续被归类为独立承包商，享有有限的福利和保护。这一裁决是对优步和 Lyft 等公司的一大胜利，他们一直反对雇员分类模式。

 **California Supreme Court Upholds Prop 22: Victory for Gig Economy Companies**

The California Supreme Court has ruled in favor of gig economy giants like Uber and Lyft by upholding Proposition 2n, which allows these companies to classify their workers as independent contractors rather than employees. This decision is a significant win for the companies and marks an end to years-long legal challenges from labor rights groups seeking to overturn Prop 22.

**Key Points:**

1. **Prop 22**, passed by California voters in 2020, exempts gig economy companies from a state law that would have classified their workers as employees. Instead, it provides limited healthcare benefits and a minimum earnings guarantee for the workers.

2. The court's decision is seen as a major victory for Uber and Lyft, who had campaigned aggressively in support of Prop 22 ahead of the vote. They argued that treating their drivers as employees would pose an existential threat to their business models.

3. Companies like Uber and DoorDash warned that reclassifying workers as employees could lead to significant additional expenses, price increases for riders, and a potential exodus of drivers due to the loss of flexibility in work hours.

4. Analysts from Jefferies estimated that repealing Prop 2n would result in substantial costs for Lyft, DoorDash, and Uber by 2025: approximately $300 million, $1 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively. The companies could offset about 85% of these additional expenses through higher fees, but this may reduce demand.

**Conclusion:**
The California Supreme Court's decision to uphold Prop 2n ensures that gig economy workers will continue to be classified as independent contractors with limited benefits and protections. This ruling is a significant win for companies like Uber and Lyft, who have long argued against the employee classification model.
