哈马斯继续停火谈判，以色列袭击其军事头目

# 以色列和哈马斯停火谈判的最新进展

**文章摘要：**

在以色列针对哈马斯军事头目穆罕默德·德伊夫（Mohammed Deif）和另一名高级激进分子拉法·萨拉梅（Rafa'a Salameh）的空袭后，以色列和哈马斯之间最近的发展情况如何？尽管这些袭击造成了90多名巴勒斯坦人伤亡，包括妇女、儿童和医务人员，但哈马斯否认暂停由美国、埃及和卡塔尔斡旋的谈判。

以色列证实萨拉梅被击毙，但德伊夫的命运仍未知。谈判旨在达成停火协议并释放以色列籍人质。然而，以色列试图消除哈马斯的军事能力，确保加沙不再构成威胁。

哈马斯对协议的一些条件有所让步，但坚持要结束这场战争。与此同时，以色列总理内塔尼亚胡坚持反对任何永久性停火或从加沙全面撤军的立场。

 **Summary of Article:**

The article discusses recent developments in ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, following Israeli air strikes targeting Mohammed Deif, the military chief of Hamas, along with another senior militant commander, Rafa'a Salameh. Despite these attacks resulting in over 90 Palestinnian casualties, including women, children, and medical personnel, Hamas has denied suspending negotiations brokered by the US, Egypt, and Qatar.

Israel confirmed that Salameh was killed but Deif's fate remains unknown. The talks aim to secure a ceasefire deal and release Israeli hostages held by Hamas. However, Israel seeks to eliminate Hamas's military capabilities and ensure Gaza no longer poses a threat.

Hamas has softened its position on some conditions for the agreement but insists that it will end the war. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains his stance against any permanent ceasefire or full withdrawal of troops from Gaza.
