星默计划在国王演讲中引入人工智能法案

# 凯尔·斯塔默宣布了人工智能法案的计划

Sir Keir Starmer计划在即将举行的国王演讲中提出人工智能法案，这是工党关于监管先进机器学习模型的竞选承诺的一部分。拟议中的立法旨在增强对尖端技术的法律保障，尤其是关注像OpenAI的ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型。这项人工智能法案是国王演讲中概述的35项法案之一，代表着斯塔默在总理任期内的雄心壮志。

工党政府还计划解决其他问题，例如取消世袭贵族在上议院的席位、增强预算责任办公室的力量、实施工人保护改革、创建失学儿童登记册以及提出网络安全法案。斯塔默的方法与前首相里希·苏纳克的战略不同，后者在人工智能开发方面更倾向于自愿协议而不是法律干预。

欧盟已经通过《人工智能法案》采取了更严格的措施，而英国政府正在考虑制定一项“法定守则”，以监管开发强大人工智能模型的公司，并确保测试数据的透明度。工党的竞选宣言强调了通过对该领域的主要参与者实施具有约束力的法规来安全地开发人工智能模型。

此外，斯塔默的政府将概述GB Energy倡议的立法，这是一家专注于可再生能源和核能项目的国有能源投资者，这是工党绿色能源计划的一部分。这与工党到2030年将电力生产产生的碳排放减少到净零的目标一致。

## 要点：

1. 凯尔·斯塔默在国王演讲中提出人工智能法案，重点关注大型语言模型和对先进技术的法律保障。

2. 工党政府计划解决各种问题，包括世袭贵族、工人保护改革、失学儿童和网络安全。

3. 斯塔默的方法与苏纳克在人工智能开发方面自愿协议的方法不同。

4. 欧盟已经通过《人工智能法案》实施了严格的人工智能监管。

5. GB Energy倡议将成为工党绿色能源计划的一部分，旨在到2030年将电力生产产生的碳排放减少到净零。

 **Summary:**  
Sir Keir Starmer plans to introduce an AI bill in the upcoming King's Speech as part of Labour's manifesto pledge to regulate advanced machine-learning models. The proposed legislation aims to enhance legal safeguards for cutting-edge technologies, particularly focusing on large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This AI bill is one among 35 bills set to be outlined in the King's Speech and represents Starmer's ambition during his premiership.

The Labour government also plans to address other issues, such as axing hereditary peers from the House of Lords, empowering the Office for Budget Responsibility, implementing worker protection reforms, creating a register of children missing from schools, and introducing a cyber security bill. Starmer's approach differs from former prime minister Rishi Sunak's strategy, which favored voluntary agreements over legal interventions in AI development.

The EU has taken stricter measures with its Artificial Intelligence Act, while the UK government is considering a "statutory code" to regulate companies developing powerful AI models and ensure transparency regarding test data. The Labour party's manifesto emphasizes safe AI model development through binding regulation on key players in this field.

Additionally, Starmer’s government will outline legislation for the GB Energy initiative, a state-owned energy investor focused on renewable and nuclear projects as part of their green energy plans. This aligns with Labour's goal to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation to net zero by 2e30.

**Key Points:**  
1. Sir Keir Starmer introduces an AI bill in the King’s Speech, focusing on large language models and legal safeguards for advanced technologies.
2. The Labour government plans to address various issues including hereditary peers, worker protection reforms, children missing from schools, and cyber security.
3. Starmer's approach differs from Rishi Sunak’s strategy of voluntary agreements in AI development.
4. EU has implemented strict regulations on AI through its Artificial Intelligence Act.
5. The GB Energy initiative will be part of Labour's green energy plans, aiming to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation to net zero by 2030.
