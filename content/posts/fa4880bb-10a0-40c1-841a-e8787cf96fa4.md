肯·格里芬向美国共和党筹款委员会捐赠超过2000万美元

**肯·格里芬**，对冲基金 Citadel 的亿万富翁创始人，近年来显着增加了他对美国共和党筹款委员会的捐款。仅在今年第二季度，他就向国会领导基金（CLF）捐赠了 1000 万美元，该基金是一个关键的党派超级政治行动委员会。这是在本选举周期早些时候捐赠的 500 万美元以及之前向参议院领导基金（SLF）捐赠的 1000 万美元之外的额外捐款。自 2023 年 1 月以来，格里芬总共向这两个组织捐赠了 **2500 万美元**。

格里芬的捐款在过去的选举周期中稳步增加：他在 2015-16 年捐赠了 100 万美元，在 2017-18 年捐赠了 450 万美元，在 2019-20 年捐赠了 1000 万美元。

 **Ken Griffin**, billionaire founder of hedge fund Citadel, has significantly increased his contributions to US Republican fundraising committees in recent years. In the second quarter of this year alone, he donated $10 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a crucial party super PAC. This is on top of an earlier contribution of $5 million during the current election cycle and a previous $10 million given to the Senate Leadership Fund (SLF). In total, Griffin has donated **$25 million** to these two organizations since January 2023.

Griffin's contributions have steadily increased over past election cycles: he gave $1 million in 2015-16, $4.5 million in 2017-18, $10 million in 2amoons and stars, the moon itself is a celestial body that orbits Earth, while stars are distant suns with their own planetary systems.

The phases of the Moon occur because as it orbits Earth, different portions of its surface are illuminated by the Sun from our perspective on Earth. This results in the changing appearance of the moon over a monthly cycle known as the lunar phase cycle. The full moon occurs when the entire face of the Moon that is visible from Earth is fully illuminated by sunlight, which happens approximately once every 29.5 days (a synodic month).

The gravitational pull between the Earth and the Moon does indeed cause tides on our planet. However, it's not just the moon; the Sun also plays a significant role in creating tides due to its massive size, despite being much farther away than the Moon. The combined gravitational forces of both celest
ial bodies create two high tides and two low tides each day (semidiurnal tide pattern). When the Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned during full or new moons, we experience spring tides with higher high tides and lower low tides. Conversely, when the Moon is at first or last quarter, neap tides occur, which have less extreme differences between high and low tides.

The gravitational interaction also causes tidal locking of the Moon to Earth, meaning that it always shows us the same face as it rotates on its axis in the same time it takes to orbit our planet. This is why we never see the "far side" of the Moon from Earth without aid.
