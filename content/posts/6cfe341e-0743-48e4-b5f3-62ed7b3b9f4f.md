德意志银行与声称自己是利率操纵案“替罪羊”的交易员达成和解

德意志银行与前交易员马修·康诺利（Matthew Connolly）就其提出的诉讼达成和解。

最近，德意志银行与被无罪释放的前交易员马修·康诺利（Matthew Connolly）达成了一项和解协议。在伦敦银行同业拆放利率（Libor）操纵丑闻中，康诺利指控该银行将他描绘成“替罪羊”。这一丑闻给银行带来了数十亿美元的罚款和处罚。

康诺利因2018年的欺诈罪被判刑，但后来上诉被联邦法官无罪释放，该法官称他是德意志银行在Libor丑闻中“最没有责任的人”。 2022年11月，他向德意志银行提起诉讼，要求赔偿1.5亿美元，并指控该银行让他承担了其他人犯下的罪行。

双方同意在周三（26日）向曼哈顿联邦法院提交了一份文件，自愿撤销诉讼，但没有提供进一步细节。此前，康诺利的法律团队声称，德意志银行说服政府“追究、起诉、替罪羊和起诉”他，尽管他在银行的Libor交易中发挥的作用很小。

德意志银行已经在2015年与美国和英国执法机构达成和解协议，支付了25亿美元的罚款，并导致7名员工被解雇，但其管理层没有受到影响。 2023年初，康诺利和前德意志银行雇员加文·布莱克（Gavin Black）的定罪在上诉时被撤销，因为法院得出结论称，“政府未能证明交易员影响的提交内容是虚假、欺骗性的或具有误导性。”

康诺利与德意志银行的和解协议没有披露双方同意的条款。

 **Deutsche Bank settles lawsuit** filed by former trader Matthew Connolly over Libor rate-rigging scandal  

In a recent development, Deutsche Bank has settled a lawsuit brought against it by exonerated former trader Matthew Connolly. The settlement comes after Connolly accused the bank of framing him as the "fall guy" in the **Libor** rate manipulation saga that cost banks billions of dollars in penalties and fines.

Convicted of fraud in 2018, Connolly was later acquitted on appeal by a federal judge who labeled him as "the least culpable person" at Deutsche Bank during the **Libor** scandal. In November 2022, he sued Deutsche for $150 million in damages and accused the bank of framing him for crimes committed by others.

The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed with the agreement of both parties as stated in a one-page filing to Manhattan federal court on Wednescuary 26th, but no further details were provided. Previously, Connolly's legal team claimed that Deutsche Bank had convinced the government to "pursue, indict, scapegoat and prosecute" him despite his minimal involvement in **Libor** at the bank.

Deutsche Bank has already paid $2.5 billion in fines over the Libor scandal as part of a 2015 settlement with US and UK law enforcement, leading to the dismissal of seven employees while its management board remained unscathed. Connolly's conviction was quashed on appeal along with that of former Deutsche employee Gavin Black in early 2023 after it was concluded that "the government failed to show that any of the trader-influenced submissions were false, fraudulent or misleading."

The settlement between Connolly and Deutsche Bank does not provide details on the terms agreed upon by both parties.
