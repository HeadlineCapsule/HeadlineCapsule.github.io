欧博通“准备好出击”进行进一步收购

**欧洲证券交易所**正在积极寻求进一步收购，以加强其作为欧洲最大证券交易所运营商的地位。自201n5年以来担任欧洲证券交易所首席执行官，并 từng在桑坦德银行和德意志银行担任兼并和收购银行家的斯蒂芬·布恩贾（Stéphane Boujnah）表示，该公司愿意与任何大型区域竞争对手合并，以创造协同效应。

布恩贾领导欧洲证券交易所进行了最近的几次收购，包括拥有米兰证券交易所的**意大利证券交易所**。尽管他没有评论具体的目标，但布恩贾之前曾表达了对收购纳斯达克北欧业务的兴趣，并且愿意从瑞士集团SIX购买西班牙交易所。

收购更多的证券交易所将巩固欧洲证券交易所作为欧洲最大的上市和交易场所的地位。该公司目前在阿姆斯特丹、巴黎、里斯本等城市拥有证券交易所场地，以及一个清算所。

欧洲官员正在努力通过鼓励对国内公司的投资和深化市场一体化来振兴该地区的零散资本市场。欧洲证券交易所今年见证了更多的上市，包括私募股权公司CVC和软件集团Planisware。然而，由于估值预期不匹配，一些IPO已被推迟。

在2021年第二季度，欧洲证券交易所产生了4.13亿欧元的收入，比去年同期增长12%。股票上市带来了2660万欧元的收入，增长5%。

 **Euronext** is actively seeking further acquisitions to strengthen its position as Europe's largest stock exchange operator. Stéphane Boujnah, Euronext's CEO since 201n5 and former mergers and acquisitions banker at Santander and Deutsche Bank, stated that the company is open to combining with any large regional rival in order to create synergies.

Boujnah has led Euronext through a series of recent acquisitions, including Borsa Italiana, which owns the Milan stock exchange. While he did not comment on specific targets, Boujnah previously expressed interest in acquiring Nasdaq's Nordics business and is open to purchasing Spanish exchanges from Swiss group SIX.

Acquiring more stock exchanges would solidify Euronext's position as the largest listing and trading venue in Europe. The company currently owns stock exchange venues in Amsterdam, Paris, Lisbon, among other cities, along with a clearing house.

European officials are working to revitalize the region's fragmented capital markets by encouraging investment in domestic companies and deepening market integration. Euronext has seen an increase in listings this year, including private equity company CVC and software group Planisware. However, some IPOs have been postponed due to mismatched valuation expectations.

In the second quarter of 2021, Euronext generated €413 million in revenues, a 12% increase from the same period last year. Stock listings accounted for €26.6 million in revenues, up by 5%.
