德国下令禁止中国公司进入其5G网络

# 德国下令禁止中国公司进入其 5G 网络

- 德国政府决定分阶段禁止华为和中兴等中国公司向该国 5G 网络供应组件。该决定将于 2029 年全面生效。

- 内政部长南希·法赛尔（Nancy Faeser）强调，这一举措对于保护德国的数字基础设施以及公民、企业和国家通信免受外国政府（尤其是中国）的间谍活动或破坏行为的威胁至关重要。

- 禁令将分两个阶段实施：

 - 到 2026 年，电信公司必须从数据中心等“核心”设施中移除中国设备，因为这些设施存在敏感信息被未经授权访问的较高风险。
 - 到 2029 年，所有剩余的中国组件都应从无线电天线等更广泛的网络和传输站点中移除。

- 该决定反映了在安全问题与维护与中国这一德国最大贸易伙伴的经济关系之间取得平衡。

- 批评人士认为，鉴于过去两年在安全政策方面的事态发展，五年宽限期过长。一些官员呼吁最迟于 2025 年从 5G 网络的核心部分中移除中国组件。

- 包括德意志电信和电话公司在内的电信运营商一直抵制移除这些组件的压力，因为他们担心会增加成本并导致数据服务中断。

- 德国的决定受到英国等其他国家的影响，英国也禁止了中国设备进入其 5G 网络，但面临着实施时间表方面的挑战。英国预计其 5G 网络将于 2027 年完全摆脱中国组件。

- 华为对这些担忧提出异议，并声称自己是可靠的供应商，并指出它在德国的长期存在证明了其技术不会带来任何安全风险。

 **Germany orders ban on Chinese companies from its 5G network**  

- The German government has decided to implement a staggered ban on Chinese components, specifically those supplied by Huawei and ZTE, within the country's domestic 5G networks. This decision is set to be fully enforced by **2029**.

- Interior Minister Nancy Faeser emphasized that this move was crucial for protecting Germany's digital infrastructure as well as its citizens', companies', and state communications from potential espionage or sabotage threats posed by foreign governments, particularly China.

- The ban will be implemented in two phases:  
  - By **2026**, telecom companies must remove Chinese equipment from "core" facilities such as data centers where the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information is higher.
  - By **2029**, all remaining Chinese components should be removed from broader network and transmission sites like radio antennas.

- The decision reflects a compromise between security concerns and maintaining good economic relations with China, Germany's largest trading partner.  

- Critics argue that the five-year grace period is too long given recent developments in security policy over the past two years. Some officials have called for an earlier removal of Chinese components from core 5G networks by **2025** at the latest.

- Telecom providers, including Deutsche Telekom and Telefónica, had resisted pressure to remove these components due to concerns about costs and potential disruptions in data services.  

- Germany's decision has been influenced by similar actions taken by other countries such as the UK, which also banned Chinese equipment from its 5G network but faced challenges with implementation timelines. The UK expects its 5G network to be free of Chinese components by **2e27**.  

- Huawei has disputed these concerns and maintains that it is a reliable supplier, citing its long history in Germany as evidence against any security risks posed by their technology.
