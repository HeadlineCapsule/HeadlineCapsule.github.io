电池制造商SK On宣布“紧急状态” 因为电动汽车销售令人失望

# 摘要：

由于欧洲和美国的新能源汽车（NEV）销售情况令人失望，电池制造商 SK On 面临“紧急”情况。自 2020 年从母公司 SK Innovation 分拆以来，该公司已连续 10 个季度录得亏损，在此期间净负债增加了一倍多。

## 要点：
- **SK On** 是韩国第四大电动汽车电池制造商，由于西方市场销售情况不佳而遭受了巨大财务损失。
- 该公司宣布进入“紧急管理”状态，并实施了削减成本的措施，同时 CEO 李石熙强调了员工之间团结一致的必要性。
- SK 集团正在考虑的潜在解决方案包括将 SK On 的母公司 SK Innovation 与另一家盈利能力强的能源子公司 SK E&S 合并。这次可能的合并将于本月提交董事会讨论。
- 中国电池巨头 CATL 和 BYD 主导着全球市场，而韩国竞争对手 LG Energy Solution、Samsung SDI 和松下由于华盛顿和布鲁塞尔限制从中国进口电池的努力而在西方市场获得了发展机会。
- 美国总统乔·拜登《通货膨胀削减法案》中的**美国补贴**惠及了非中国电池制造商，包括 SK On。然而，分析师 Tim Bush 认为，美国汽车制造商未能生产出对大众消费者有吸引力的电动汽车，导致销售量低于预期。
- 尽管 SK On 目前面临挑战，但分析师相信，如果它继续得到 SK 集团的广泛支持作为一项奖杯资产，其长期前景可能是确定的。

 **Article Summary:**  

Battery manufacturer SK On faces an "emergency" situation due to disappointing electric vehicle (EV) sales in Europe and the US. The company has recorded losses for 10 consecutive quarters since its separation from parent company SK Innovation in 202amojiu, with net debt increasing more than fivefold during this period.

**Key Points:**  
- **SK On** is South Korea's fourth-largest EV battery maker and has experienced significant financial losses due to lower-than-expected sales in western markets.
- The company declared a state of "emergency management" with cost-cutting measures, as its CEO Lee Seok-hee emphasized the need for unity among employees.
- **Potential solutions** being considered within SK Group include merging SK On's parent company, SK Innovation, with another profitable energy affiliate, SK E&S. This potential merger will be discussed at the board level this month.
- Chinese battery giants CATL and BYD dominate the global market, while South Korean competitors LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and Panasonic have been given opportunities to grow in western markets due to efforts by Washington and Brussels to limit imported batteries from China.
- **US subsidies** under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act have benefited non-Chinese battery makers, including SK On. However, analyst Tim Bush argues that US car manufacturers failed to produce attractive EVs for mass market consumers, leading to lower sales than projected.
- Despite the current challenges faced by SK On, analysts believe its long-term future is likely assured if it continues receiving support from the wider SK Group as a trophy asset.
