顶级科技投资者：英伟达十年内可能达到50万亿美元市值

科技投资者詹姆斯·安德森（James Anderson）预测，由于英伟达在人工智能和聊天机器人等生成模型中的作用，其市值在未来十年内可能接近5万亿美元。自2018年8月以来，该公司股价上涨了20倍，而今年股价上涨了162%以上。安德森将英伟达的成功归因于持续的指数级进步、竞争优势、文化以及领导力。他把人工智能对数据中心的需求增长速度比作每年约60%，并预计在十年内每股收益可达1350美元，这可能使英伟达的市值达到约49万亿美元。

关键点：
- 詹姆斯·安德森认为，如果人工智能为客户所接受并保持领先地位，那么英伟达的潜在规模可能“远高于我见过的任何水平”，在十年内达到市值位数万亿美元的可能性，而不是预测。
- 英伟达是受益于对训练生成式人工智能模型（如聊天机器人）的芯片需求增加的主要公司。自今年1月以来，其股价上涨了162%，市值超过3万亿美元。
- 该公司“持续的指数级进步”、硬件和软件方面的竞争优势、文化以及领导力是成功因素。
- 安安德森在林格托投资管理公司（Lingotto Investment Management）管理着6.5亿美元的基金，其中英伟达是最大的持股。他之前在巴克莱吉斐逊公司（Baillie Gifford）管理苏格兰抵押贷款投资信托公司（Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust）。
- 影响安德森投资流程的重要学术人物是亨德里克·贝塞姆宾德（Hendrik Bessembinder），他发现只有4%的股票在几十年内创造了所有净财富。这一信念指导他们寻找像英伟达这样的极端赢家。
- 数据中心人工智能芯片需求的真实增长速度似乎约为每年60%。如果这种情况持续下去，安德森预计在未来十年内每股收益可达1350美元，每股自由现金流约为1000美元，这意味着在十年内英伟达的股价可能达到2万美元，市值约49万亿美元。
- 目前，所有S&P 500公司市值的总和约为47万亿美元。
- 安安德森承认，实现这种增长的道路可能会很波动，建议在出现35%-40%的潜在下跌时买入更多。
- 英伟达目前的交易价格是今年预计每股收益的47倍以上，占S&P 500今年17.7%收益的近30%。

 **Summary:**  
Tech investor James Anderson predicts Nvidia's potential market cap could reach nearly $5n in the next decade due to its role in AI and generative models like ChatGPT. The company has seen a 20-fold increase since August 2018, with shares surging over 162% this year alone. Anderson attributes Nvidia's success to persistent exponential progress, competitive advantages, culture, and leadership. He compares the growth of AI demand for data centers at about 60% per year to potential earnings of $1,350 per share in a decade, which could result in an Nvidia market cap of approximately $49tn.

**Key Points:**  
- James Anderson sees Nvidia's potential scale as "way higher than I’ve ever seen" with the possibility of reaching double-digit trillions in market cap over a decade, though not a prediction but a possibility if AI works for customers and maintains its lead.
- Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of increased demand for chips used to train generative AI models like ChatGPT. Its shares have surged 162% since January this year, pushing market value above $3tn.
- The company's "persistent exponential progress," competitive advantages in hardware and software, culture, and leadership are factors contribnent to its success.
- Anderson manages a $650mn fund at Lingotto Investment Management with Nvidia as the largest position. He previously managed Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust at Baillie Gifford.
- A crucial influence on Anderson's investment process is academic Hendrik Bessembinder, who found that just 4% of stocks accounted for all net wealth creation over many decades. This belief has guided their search for extreme winners like Nvidia.
- Real growth in data center AI chip demand appears to be running at about 60% per year. If this continues, Anderson estimates earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of about $1,000 a share over the next decade, translating into an Nvidia share worth $20,000 in 10 years or a market cap of approximately $49tn.
- The current combined market capitalization of all companies in the S&P 500 is roughly $47tn.
- Anderson acknowledges that the path to such growth will likely be volatile and advises buying more during potential drawdowns of 35-40%.
- Nvidia currently trades at over 47 times its estimated earnings per share for the coming year, contributing almost 30% of the S&P 500's 17.7% gain this year.
