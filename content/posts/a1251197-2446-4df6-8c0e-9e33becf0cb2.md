欧洲央行警告该区域经济面临风险

# 欧洲中央银行（ECB）警告欧元区经济风险

ECB 对不断升级的贸易紧张局势、高额政府债务以及欧洲向民粹主义和保护主义转型的趋势表示担忧。这些问题在葡萄牙举行的欧洲央行年度会议上进行了讨论。法国最近的大选，极右翼亲欧怀疑论者玛丽娜·勒庞获胜，被视为这一更广泛趋势的标志。

## 法国选举信号民粹主义和保护主义转向

玛丽娜·勒庞领导的政党在法国议会选举的第一轮投票中获胜，引发了ECB政策制定者对潜在民粹主义、保护主义和动荡转型的担忧。这可能对欧洲经济产生重大影响。

## 美国、中国和欧盟之间的贸易紧张局势加剧

美国提高了对华进口商品的关税，包括电动汽车和半导体。欧盟也提高了对中国电动汽车进口征收的关税，即将生效。北京威胁要对这些行动进行报复。潜在的贸易战可能会对高度依赖出口的欧元区经济产生不成比例的影响，因为出口占其GDP的一半以上。

## ECB政策制定者警告经济碎片化和供应冲击

爱尔兰央行行长加布里埃尔·马克洛夫表达了对经济碎片化和可能导致价格影响并增加自给自足的供应冲击的担忧。斯洛文尼亚央行行长博斯特扬·瓦舍也强调了欧元区财政政策和债务规则相关的风险。

## 通货膨胀趋势向下；利率可能保持不变

欧元区通货膨胀率从2.6%降至2.5%，重现下降趋势。尽管如此，由于欧元区服务业的强劲劳动力市场和工资增长，ECB政策制定者几乎肯定会在即将举行的会议上保持利率不变。

## ECB行长克里斯蒂娜·拉加德强调在不确定性中采取谨慎的必要性

ECB行长克里斯蒂娜·拉加德强调，鉴于贸易紧张局势和政治发展带来的不确定性，政策制定者应花时间收集新信息，然后再就利率做出任何决定。

 **European Central Bank (ECB) warns of risks for Eurozone economy**  
The ECB has expressed concerns over rising trade tensions, high government debt, and a shift towards populism and protectionism in Europe. These issues were discussed at the annual conference held by European central bankers in Portugal. The recent French elections, where Marine Le Pen's far-right eurosceptic party won, are seen as indicative of this broader trend.

**French Elections Signal Shift Towards Populism and Protectionism**  
The victory of Marine Le Pen’s party in the first round of France’s parliamentary election has raised concerns among ECB policymakers about a potential shift towards populism, protectionism, and turbulence. This could have significant implications for Europe's economy.

**Trade Tensions Between US, China, and EU Intensify**  
The US has increased tariffs on imports from China, including electric vehicles and semiconductors. The EU followed suit with higher levies on Chinese EV imports set to take effect soon. Beijing threatened retaliation against these moves. A potential trade war could have a disproportionate impact on the Eurozone economy due to its heavy reliance on exports, which account for more than half of its GDP.

**ECB Policymakers Warn Against Economic Fragmentation and Supply Shocks**  
Gabriel Makhlouf, Ireland’s central bank governor, expressed concerns about economic fragmentation and the possibility of supply shocks that could lead to price impacts and increased self-sufficiency. Bostjan Vasle, Slovenia's central bank governor, also highlighted risks associated with fiscal policy and debt rules in the Eurozone.

**Inflation Trends Downward; Interest Rates Likely to Remain Unchanged**  
Eurozone inflation has resumed its downward trajectory at 2.5% year-on-year, following a brief pickup to 2.6%. Despite this trend, ECB policymakers are almost certain to leave interest rates unchanged in their upcoming meeting due to the strong labor market and wage growth in the Eurozone's services sector.

**ECB President Christine Lagarde Emphasizes Need for Caution Amidst Uncertainty**  
Christine Lagarde, ECB president, emphasized that policymakers should take time to gather new information before making any decisions on interest rates due to the uncertainty surrounding trade tensions and political developments in Europe.
