比特币暴涨，因为交易员押注特朗普选举获胜后枪击事件

# **比特币在唐纳德·特朗普遇刺企图期间飙升**

- 在针对前总统唐纳德·特朗普的枪击事件发生后，比特币的价值上涨了10%以上，因为交易员增加了对他在即将到来的美国总统选举中获胜的潜在胜利的押注。比特币价格达到两周以来的最高水平，达到63,595美元。
- 特朗普被认为比其他候选人更支持加密货币，因为他举办了行业高管会议，并表达了对美国基于比特币挖矿的支持。他的竞选活动也接受了加密货币付款，这引起了人们的希望，即从美国最近对加密货币行业的监管整顿中脱离出来。
- 市场分析师Grzegorz Dróżdż表示，“唐纳德·特朗普获胜的可能性显著增加”，并补充说，这种结果将对比特币等加密货币产生积极影响。
- 在枪击事件发生后，预测性政治博彩网站PredictIt上特朗普11月获胜的隐含概率跳涨。与特朗普相关的股票也出现了上涨：真相社交媒体公司的股票收盘上涨31%，特朗普媒体和技术集团在近期与空白支票公司的合并之前也出现上涨。
- 监狱运营商Geo Group和CoreCivic的股价上涨，而美国枪支制造商Sturm Ruger＆Co和Smith＆Wesson Brands也在这一事件后飙升。
- 标普500指数小幅上涨，但没有达到新的纪录高点。分析师认为，特朗普的潜在第二个任期可能会导致税收削减、赤字增加、通货膨胀以及美国国债收益率上升，就像他在今年早些时候首次选举获胜时一样。
- 尽管交易员提高了联邦储备银行9月降息的押注，但美元指数保持稳定。

 **Bitcoin Surge Amidst Assassination Attempt on Donald Trump**

- Bitcoin's value surged over 10% following a shooting incident targeting former President Donald Trump, as traders increased their bets on his potential victory in the upcoming US presidential election. The price of bitcoin reached its highest level in two weeks at $63,595.
- Trump is perceived to be more pro-crypto than other candidates due to hosting industry executives and expressing support for US-based bitcoin mining. His campaign has also accepted cryptocurrency payments, raising hopes of a departure from the recent regulatory crackdown on the crypto industry in the United States.
- Market analyst Grzegorz Dróżdż stated that "the probability of a Donald Trump victory has increased significantly," and added that such an outcome would positively impact cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.
- Following the shooting, implied odds for Trump's win in November jumped on PredictIt, a political betting site. Stocks related to Trump also saw gains: Truth Social media company shares closed 31% higher and Trump Media & Technology Group rallied ahead of its recent merger with a blank-cheque company.
- Prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic experienced stock increases, while US gun makers Sturm Ruger & Co and Smith & Wesson Brands also surged in response to the event.
- The S&P 500 closed slightly higher but did not reach a new record high. Analysts believe that Trump's potential second term could lead to tax cuts, increased deficits, inflation, and higher US Treasury yields similar to his first election win in amoorning of the year.
- The US dollar index remained steady despite traders raising their bets on a September interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.
