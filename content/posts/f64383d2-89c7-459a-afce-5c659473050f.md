什么导致了全球大规模的IT停机事件？

**全球IT中断总结：**

安全技术供应商CrowdStrike的一次小更新导致了有史以来最大的全球IT中断之一。受影响的系统包括运行Microsoft Windows的PC和服务器，在全球范围内对企业和个人造成了广泛的影响。这一事件突显了IT行业的公司所做的看似微小的技术更改可能产生重大后果。

由于CrowdStrike的Windows版Falcon软件更新中存在缺陷，许多Windows设备出现了“蓝色死亡屏幕”。该问题与安全事件或网络攻击无关，CrowdStrike声称已经部署了修复程序。然而，中断的影响仍然很大，影响了多个大陆的航空公司、银行、广播公司的行业和医疗保健提供商。

CrowdStrike是端点安全软件的最大提供商之一，保护计算机网络与远程设备之间的连接，例如笔记本电脑、手机、服务器、零售支付终端和现金机器。中断还影响了Microsoft Azure云计算平台的客户，因为周四晚上出现了无关的问题。

受影响系统的恢复过程可能需要数天甚至数周的时间，因为IT支持资源因需求而紧张。一些用户报告说，可能需要多达15次重新启动才能修复Azure服务方面的问题。

 **Summary of Global IT Outage Caused by Minor Update:**

A minor update from CrowdStrike, a security technology vendor, has resulted in one of the biggest global IT outages ever. The affected systems include PCs and servers running Microsoft Windows, causing widespread disruption to businesses and individuals worldwide. This incident highlights how seemingly small technical changes can have significant consequences when made by companies within the IT industry.

The "blue screen of death" has been observed on many Windows-based devices due to a defect found in CrowdStrike's Falcon software update for Windows. The issue is not related to security incidents or cyber attacks, and CrowdStrike claims that a fix has already been deployed. However, the extent of the outage remains significant, impacting industries such as airlines, banks, broadcasters, and healthcare providers across multiple continents.

CrowdStrike is one of the largest providers of endpoint security software, which protects connections between computer networks and remote devices like laptops, phones, servers, retail payment terminals, and cash machines. The outage has also affected Microsoft'cu Azure cloud computing platform customers due to an unrelated earlier issue on Thursday evening.

The recovery process for the affected systems may take days or even weeks, as IT support resources are stretched thin by the demand. Some users have reported that up to 15 reboots might be required to fix problems with aspects of Azure services.
