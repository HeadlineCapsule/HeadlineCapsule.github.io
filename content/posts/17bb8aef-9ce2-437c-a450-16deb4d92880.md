美国零售商支付溢价，在假期销售中下大注

**摘要：**
由于供应链中断和货运费用上涨，美国零售商比往年更早地开始运送节假日商品。这一转变旨在缓解高峰购物季节可能出现的空货架问题，尽管物流挑战和集装箱空间需求强劲导致成本增加。

**要点：
- 由于红海船只遭到袭击导致供应链中断，导致运输路线延长和港口拥堵加剧，美国零售商将高峰运输季节从7月提前到4月或5月。
- 自2023年11月以来，由于这些挑战，货运的综合现货价格上涨了超过200%，承运人如马士基警告说可能会进一步上涨。
- 较大的进口商，如沃尔玛和目标公司，已确保了低于现货市场价格的多年合同，而较小的托运人则面临提前发货的更高成本。
- 尽管费用增加，但零售商对假期消费者的支出持乐观态度，根据全国零售联合会（NRF）的数据，预计今年夏天美国进口量将达到两年来的最高水平。
- NRF预测今年零售销售额将增长2.5%-3.5%，并预计全年需求强劲。

 **Summary:**
US retailers are payily adapting to supply chain disruptions and increased freight rates by shipping holiday goods earlier than usual. The shift aims to mitigate potential empty shelves during peak shopping season, despite facing higher costs due to the combination of logistics challenges and strong demand for container space.

**Key Points:
- US retailers are moving up their peak shipping season from July to October to April or May in response to supply chain disruptions caused by attacks on ships in the Red Sea, which have led to longer transit routes and increased port congestion.
- The composite spot rate for freight has surged more than 200% since November 2023 due to these challenges, with carriers like Maersk warning of further increases.
- Larger importers such as Walmart and Target have secured multiyear contracts below spot market prices, while smaller shippers face higher costs for earlier shipments.
- Despite the increased expenses, retailers are optimistic about consumer spending during the holiday season, with US imports expected to reach their highest levels in two years this summer according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).
- The NRF projects a 2.5%-3.5% growth in retail sales for the year and anticipates strong demand throughout the remainder of the year.
