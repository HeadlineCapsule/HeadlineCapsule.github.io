诺和诺德因未披露付款受到批评

# 新北欧斯克因未披露付款而受到训诫

英国制药行业协会公开训诫了奥司美肽和维格维的制造商新北欧斯克，因为其未能妥善披露 2020-2022 年价值 780 万英镑的资金转移。处方药物守则实践管理局（PMCPA）发现，在向超过 150 个不同机构披露付款和福利方面存在系统性合规失败，这些机构包括患者团体、医疗保健组织和记者。

这一训诫是新北欧斯克在发现该期间报告存在错误后自愿提交的。尽管没有因违规而受到经济处罚，但这次公开批评对该公司声誉造成了重大打击。此前，由于违反赞助规则，ABPI 已暂停新北欧斯克的成员资格两年。

未披露的付款包括向医疗保健专业人员和组织、个人患者和患者团体以及记者提供的付款。然而，PMCPA 没有披露个人付款的大小或收款人。新北欧斯克表示，它认真对待这些报告问题，并正在与外部合作伙伴合作，以确保建立健全的系统来跟踪、标记和披露付款。

随着减肥药物的需求增长，制药行业继续受到政治家和监管机构的审查。最近，美国总统乔·拜登和参议员伯尼·桑德斯呼吁新北欧斯克和礼来公司降低其减肥药物的价格。

除了新北欧斯克的训诫之外，瑞士制药集团诺华和美国竞争对手辉瑞也被 PMCPA 发现存在轻微违规行为，涉及过时的处方信息和在临床批准前在社交媒体上推广新冠疫苗。

 **Novo Nordisk Reprimand Over Undisclosed Payments**  
The UK pharmaceutical industry body has publicly reprimanded Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, over its failure to properly disclose £7.8 million in transfers of value from 2020-2022. The Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA) found that there was a systemic failure in compliance with the disclosure of payments and benefits made to over 150 different bodies, including patient groups, healthcare organizations, and journalists.

The reprimand follows Novo Nordisk's voluntary submission after discovering errors in its reporting during that period. Although there are no financial penalties associated with the breach, this public rebuke deals a significant blow to the company's reputation. The ABPI had previously suspended Novo Nordisk's membership for two years due to violations of sponsorship rules.

The undisclosed payments included those made to healthcare professionals and organizations, individual patients and patient groups, as well as journalists. However, the PMCPA did not disclose the size or recipients of individual payments. Novo Nordisk has stated that it takes these reporting issues seriously and is working with external partners to ensure robust systems are in place for tracking, tagging, and disclosing payments.

The pharmaceut ical industry continues to face scrutiny from politicians and regulators as demand for weight-loss drugs grows. Recently, US President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders called on Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to reduce the prices of their weight-loss medications.

In addition to Novo Nordisk's reprimand, Swiss pharma group Novartis and US competitor Pfizer were also found in breach of disclosure requirements by the PMCPA for minor infractions involving outdated prescribing information and promoting a Covid-19 vaccine on social media before clinical approval.
