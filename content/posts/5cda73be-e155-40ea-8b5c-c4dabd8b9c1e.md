美联储预计将保持利率不变，但为9月降息做准备

**美联储预计将在即将举行的会议上维持其基准利率在23年来的高位5.25%-5.5%，但信号表明可能提前至9月降息。这一态度转变是在通货膨胀放缓和劳动力市场状况走软的背景下发生的。

**要点：**

1. 美联储预计将在即将举行的会议上将利率保持在5.25%-5.5%不变，但可能会信号可能提前至9月降息，因为通胀得到控制，劳动力市场放缓。
2. 近几个月来，通货膨胀有所缓解，美联储首选的衡量标准现在约为2.6%，低于2022年的峰值。
3. 劳动力市场出现软化迹象，招聘率下降，裁员增加。这可能会促使美联储降低利率，以支持美国企业和借款人。
4. 经济学家预计美联储将承认在控制通胀目标方面取得的进展，并对管理通胀风险表达信心，同时认识到由于劳动力市场疲弱需要采取政策措施。
5. 美联储是否降息的决定将取决于7月和9月会议之间的数据，一些经济学家认为推迟至9月降息可能会增加经济衰退的风险。
6. 在美联储内部对利率路径存在不同观点，但官员们普遍倾向于在9月之前等待，以确保他们对通胀和劳动力市场状况有充分了解。

 **Summary:**  
The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at a 23-year high of 5.25-5.5% during its upcoming meeting, but signals are pointing towards a potential cut as early as September. This shift in stance comes amid easing inflation and softening labor market conditions.

**Key Points:**  
1. The Federal Reserve is likely to keep the interest rate steady at 5.25-5.5% during its upcoming meeting, but may signal a potential cut as early as September due to improved inflation control and a slowing labor market.
2. Inflation has eased in recent months, with the central bank's preferred gauge now hovering around 2.6%, below its peak of 2022.
3. The labor market is showing signs of softening, as hiring rates have decreased and layoffs are on the rise. This may prompt the Fed to lower interest rates in order to support American businesses and borrowers.
4. Economists expect the Federal Reserve to acknowledge progress made towards its inflation goal and express confidence in managing inflation risks, while also recognizing the need for a policy response due to labor market weakness.
5. The Fed's decision on whether or not to cut rates will depend on incoming data between July and September meetings, with some economists arguing that delaying a rate cut until September may increase recession risks.
6. There are differing views within the Federal Reserve regarding the appropriate path for interest rates, but officials generally prefer waiting until September before initiating any easing measures to ensure they have a firm grasp on inflation and labor market conditions.
