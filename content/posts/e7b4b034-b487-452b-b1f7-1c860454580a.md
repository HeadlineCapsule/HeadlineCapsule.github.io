科拉诺维奇（Kolanovic）在做出一系列时机不当的股票市场预测后将离开摩根大通。

**科拉诺维奇离开摩根大通**

马克·科拉诺维奇（Marko Kolanovic）将离开摩根大通全球市场策略师的职位，此前他连续做出时机不当的股市预测，结束他在这家美国银行的 19 年任期。他是华尔街少数看空分析师之一，曾预测标准普尔 500 指数将从当前水平下跌近 **25%**。

科拉诺维奇作为“移动市场的人”声名鹊起，但近年来由于他的逆势呼声与市场走势不一致，声誉有所下降。在过去的两年里，他建议客户在卖盘期间采取超配策略，然后在今年初建议采取低配策略。自那以来，标准普尔 500 指数上涨了超过 **40%**。

科拉诺维奇拥有纽约大学理论高能物理学的博士学位，曾在贝尔斯蒂恩斯和美林证券工作过，然后加入摩根大通。据一位了解情况的内幕人士透露，他现在将“探索其他机会”。侯赛因·马利克（Hussein Malik）将成为全球研究部门的唯一负责人，而杜布拉夫科·拉科斯-布贾斯（Dubravko Lakos-Bujas）将接任市场策略师的新职位，负责股票和宏观经济研究。

尽管摩根大通的策略师上周重申了他们的熊市观点，强调美国股市缺乏“可怕”的广度。他们认为，经济软着陆的结果很难实现，并建议在增长屈服于限制性货币政策之前提高利率。尽管他们青睐高质量的大型股，但承认低估了“六大”的韧性，这推动了标准普尔 500 指数最近的涨势。

本周，标准普尔 500 指数创出新高，而加权指数和小型股罗素 2000 在过去两年几乎没有增长。

 **Kolanovic's Departure from JPMorgan**

Marko Kolanovic is leaving his role as JPMorgan’s chief global markets strategist after a series of mistimed stock market forecasts, ending his 19-year tenure at the US bank. He was one of the few bearish analysts on Wall Street and had predicted that the S&P 500 would drop by nearly **25%** from current levels by year-end.

Kolanovic's reputation as "the man who moves markets" has declined in recent years due to his contrarian calls, which did not align with market movements. In the past two years, he advised clients to take an overweight position during a sell-off and then recommended an underweight position early this year. The S&P 500 index surged more than **40%** since that recommendation.

Kolanovic holds a PhD in theoretical high-energy physics from New York University, with previous experience at Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch before joining JPMorgan. He will now be "exploring other opportunities," according to an insider familiar with the situation. Hussein Malik is set to become sole head of global research, while Dubravko Lakos-Bujas takes over markets strategy in a new role encompassing equities and macroeconomic research.

Despebite JPMorgan's strategists reiterated their bearish outlook last week, highlighting an "awful" lack of breadth in the US stock market. They argued that a soft-landing outcome for the economy would be difficult to achieve and suggested higher rates until growth surrenders to restrictive monetary policy. Despite preferring high-quality large-cap stocks, they admitted underestimating the resiliency of the "Magnificent Six," which drove most recent gains in the S&P 500 index.

The S&P 500 reached a fresh all-time high this week, while the equal-weighted index and small-cap Russell 2000 have seen minimal growth over the past two years.
