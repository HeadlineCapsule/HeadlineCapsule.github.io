乔·拜登说他在辩论中“搞砸了”，正努力挽救其竞选活动。

# 乔·拜登承认在辩论中犯了错误，但仍然致力于竞选连任

在最近的一次采访中，美国总统乔·拜登承认在与唐纳德·特朗普的辩论中犯了错误，并承认自己“搞砸了”。尽管遇到这个挫折，拜登仍然决心继续他的连任竞选。他计划前往摇摆州进行一系列旅行，并参加电视访谈，作为重启竞选活动的一部分。

由于年龄（81岁）而对拜登担任总统职务的适合性提出了担忧，拜登在民主党内部面临着越来越大的压力。然而，拜登在白宫独立日庆祝活动中得到了支持者们的鼓励，并向他们保证他会“坚持下去”。

据报道，总统的竞选团队建议他优先考虑睡眠，并减少工作时间。面对人们对他的健康状况的担忧，拜登开玩笑说这只是大脑的问题，但后来强调了休息和工作之间取得平衡的重要性。

在白宫紧急会议之后，几位民主党州长表达了对拜登担任总统职务适合性的支持。预计总统将在与家人团聚后前往威斯康星州，在那里他将继续在宾夕法尼亚等摇摆州进行竞选活动。

尽管辩论后的民意调查出现下降，一些民主党国会议员呼吁拜登退出竞选，但他的副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯表达了对他的支持。如果拜登退出的话，特朗普总统的顾问们表示，他们预计哈里斯将取代拜登成为民主党候选人。

**要点：**

1. 乔·拜登承认在与唐纳德·特朗普的辩论中犯了错误，但仍然致力于竞选连任。

 **Article Summary**

In a recent interview, President Joe Biden admitted to making mistakes during his debate with Donald Trump and acknowledged that he "screwed up." Despite this setback, Biden remains determined to continue his re-election campaign. He plans to embark on a series of trips to swing states and participate in TV interviews as part of an effort to reset his campaign.

Biden's candidacy has faced mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party, with concerns raised about his fitness for office due to his age (81 years old). However, Biden received support from a supporter at a White House Independence Day celebration and reassured them by saying he is "not going anywhere."

The president's campaign team has reportedly advised him to prioritize sleep and work fewer hours. In response to concerns about his health, Biden joked that it was just his brain but later emphasized the importance of striking a balance between rest and work.

Several Democratic governors have expressed their support for Biden's fitness for office following an emergency White House meeting. The president is expected to spend time with family before heading to Wisconsin, where he will continue campaigning in swing states like Pennsylvania.

Despite a decline in public opinion polls after the debate and calls from some Democratic members of Congress for Biden to drop out of the race, his vice-president Kamala Harris has voiced her support for him. President Trump's advisers have suggested that they anticipate Harris replacing Biden on the Democratic ticket if he were to step down.

**Key Points:**
1. Joe Biden admits mistakes during debate with Donald Trump, but remains committed to re-election campaign.
2. Plans for trips to swing states and TV interviews as part of a reset strategy.
3. Concerns raised within the Democratic Party about Biden's fitness due to age; however, he receives support from party members and supporters.
4. Advice given to prioritize sleep and work-life balance.
5. Vice President Kamala Harris expresses her support for Biden amidst speculation of a potential ticket change if Biden were to step down.
