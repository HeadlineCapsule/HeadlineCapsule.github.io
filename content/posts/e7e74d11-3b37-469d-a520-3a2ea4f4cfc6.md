英国和欧盟考虑首次峰会以改善脱欧后的关系

# 英国和欧盟考虑首次峰会

英国（UK）和欧盟（EU）正在考虑举行首次双边峰会，以在脱欧后改善关系。这是英国工党首相基尔·斯塔默（Keir Starmer）努力重置脱欧后关系的一部分。这次拟议中的峰会将类似于欧盟与印度和中国等第三国举行的峰会。

## 要点：
- 英国工党领袖基尔·斯塔默旨在建立国防联盟，并缓和英国和欧盟之间的贸易紧张局势，例如在农产品领域。
- 考虑举行首次双边峰会，是重置脱欧后关系的努力的一部分。
- 斯塔默将在布伦海姆宫（Blenheim Palace）接待近50位欧洲领导人，这次会议可以为他提供一个机会，与多位同行领导人进行“快速约会”。
- 双方都谨慎表示，该计划处于早期阶段，但英国和欧盟官员已经开始讨论。

## 潜在关注领域：
1. **国防联盟**：斯塔默寻求与欧盟达成一项广泛的国防和安全协议，以加强这两个领域的联系。
2. **贸易紧张局势**：将努力缓和贸易紧张局势，特别是在农产品等领域。
3. **峰会形式**：拟议中的峰会将遵循欧盟与印度和中国等第三国举行的峰会的格式。
4. **协议的实施**：一位欧盟高级官员强调，尽管对探索更具战略性的关系持开放态度，但有效地执行现有协议对双方都至关重要。
5. **超越“挑选和选择”**：欧盟不想回到脱欧谈判中的“挑选和选择”方法，而是希望真正尝试重置关系。

 **UK and EU Consider First Summit**  
The United Kingdom (UK) and European Union (EU) are contemplating their first bilateral summit to improve relations following Brexit, as part of UK Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to "reset" the post-Brexit relationship. The proposed summit would be similar to those held by the EU with third countries such as India and China.

**Key Points:**  
- **Keir Starmer,** leader of the UK Labour Party, aims to establish a defence pact and ease trade tensions in areas like agricultural goods between the UK and the EU.
- The first bilateral summit is being considered as part of efforts to reset the post-Brexit relationship.
- Starmer will host nearly 50 European leaders at Blenheim Palace, a meeting that could provide an opportunity for him to "speed date" several fellow leaders.
- Both sides caution that the plan is in its early stages; however, discussions have begun between UK and EU officials.

**Potential Areas of Focus:**  
1. **Defence Pact:** Starmer seeks a wide-ranging defence and security pact with the EU to strengthen ties on these fronts.
2. **Trade Tensions:** Efforts will be made to ease trade tensions, particularly in areas such as agricultural goods.
3. **Summit Format:** The proposed summit would follow a similar format to those held by the EU with third countries like India and China.
4. **Implementation of Agreements:** A senior EU official emphasized that while there is openness to exploring more strategic relationships, it remains crucial for both parties to implement existing agreements effectively.
5. **Beyond 'Pick and Choose':** The EU does not wish to return to the "pick and choose" approach from earlier Brexit negotiations but instead seeks a genuine attempt at resetting relations.
