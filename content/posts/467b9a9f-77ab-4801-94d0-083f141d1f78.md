霍克斯摩尔餐饮连锁店出售

**哈克斯摩尔餐饮连锁店上市出售**

据报道，哈克斯摩尔（Hawksmoor）餐饮连锁店正在寻求扩大其国际影响力，估值约1亿英镑，已挂牌出售。该集团聘请了斯蒂芬斯投资银行（Stephens Investment Bank）来运行销售流程，并已开始与潜在买家接洽。自2016年以来，石墨资本（Graphite Capital）一直持有哈克斯摩尔51%的股份。

该公司的首席执行官兼联合创始人威尔·贝克特（Will Beckett）和另一名联合创始人休·戈特（Huw Gott）将保留他们的少数股权，继续领导公司。哈克斯摩尔在全球范围内运营着13家门店，其中10家位于英国，最近在芝加哥和都柏林开设了新门店。

该餐饮连锁店的销售流程正值其海外扩张之际，此前于2021年在纽约开设了第一家美国门店。该公司预计今年销售额将超过1亿英镑，并保持稳定增长。哈克斯摩尔成立于2006年，是一家提供高质量牛排的餐厅，之前曾考虑过IPO，但由于疫情对酒店业的影响而搁置了计划。

在私募股权集团面临压力，需要出售其创纪录的3万亿美元未售资产之际，探索出售该连锁店也正值全球收购价值增长22%但数量减少的时刻，这是由较小交易数量减少造成的。

 **Hawksmoor Restaurant Chain Up for Sale**

The Hawksmoor restaurant chain is reportedly up for sale with an estimated value of around £100 million, as it seeks to expand its international presence. The investment bank Stephens has been hired to run the sales process and has begun speaking to potential buyers. Graphite Capital currently owns 51% of Hawksmoor since 201

The company's CEO and co-founder Will Beckett, along with another co-founder Huw Gott who own a minority stake, will retain their shareholding to continue leading the company. Hawksmoor operates 13 locations globally, including 10 in the UK, and has recently opened new venues in Chicago and Dublin.

The restaurant chain's sales process comes amidst its expansion abroad following a debut US site in New York in 2021. The company expects to surpass £100 million in sales this year with consistent growth. Hawksmoor was established in 2006 as a place for better-quality steak and had previously considered an IPO before shelving plans due to the pandemic's impact on the hospitality industry.

The exploration of a sale comes at a time when private equity groups face pressure to sell some of their record $3tn in unsold assets, as global takeovers have increased by 22% in value but decreased in number due to fewer smaller transactions.
