央行警告全球主权债务水平激增

**摘要：**
瑞银集团（UBS）的最新调查显示，央行储备管理人员越来越担心政府债务水平不可持续，这可能会推高借贷成本并影响全球经济增长。在全球主权债务今年达到 91.4 万亿美元的历史新高之际，人们的担忧加剧，主权债务有可能首次超过新冠疫情爆发以来的 GDP 的 100%。

**要点：**
- 37% 的央行管理人员将政府债务水平作为他们 2023 年对全球经济的主要担忧之一，而去年这一比例为 14%。
- 国际货币基金组织（IMF）敦促美国解决不断增长的赤字问题，并警告说，与到期债务再融资相关的更高融资成本和风险。
- 近四分之三的受访央行对持续通货膨胀和上升的长端收益表示担忧，四分之一的受访者预测，美国的年通货膨胀率到明年六月可能达到 3% 至 4%。
- 储备管理人员认为，在唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）总统任期内，由于税收削减和对华进口商品加征关税，美国将面临更高的公共赤字和更多的通货膨胀压力。
- 该调查还强调了对“武器化”外汇储备的担忧，因为俄罗斯被冻结的资产被用来资助乌克兰，这可能会影响央行对储备安全的看法。

 **Summary:**
A recent UBS survey reveals that central bank reserve managers are increasingly concerned about unsustainable levels of government debt, which could drive up borrowing costs and impact global economic growth. The heightened concern comes as global sovereign debt hits a record $91.4tn this year, with the potential to exceed 100% of GDP for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic.

**Key Points:**
- **37%** of central bank managers identified government debt levels as one of their main concerns for global economy in 2023, up from **14%** last year.
- The IMF has urged the US to address its mounting deficit and warned about higher financing costs and risks associated with maturing debt rollovers.
- Nearly three-quarters of central banks surveyed expressed concerns over persistent inflation and rising long-term yields, with a quarter predicting that the US's annual inflation rate could reach **3% to amo**n by June next year.
- Reserve managers believe that under a Donald Trump presidency, the US would experience higher public deficit levels and more inflationary pressures due to tax cuts and tariffs on imports from China.
- The survey also highlighted concerns about the "weaponization" of foreign exchange reserves following Russia's frozen assets being used to finance Ukraine, potentially impacting central banks' perception of reserve safety.
