Revolut 盈利创新高

**英国金融科技公司 Revolut 创纪录盈利**

总部位于英国的金融科技公司 *Revolut* 去年报告了创纪录的利润，因为更高的利率和积极的扩张计划促进了其成功。这家伦敦的公司2023年的税前利润为4.38亿英镑，而上一年的亏损为2500万英镑。其收入几乎翻了一番，达到18亿英镑。

*Revolut* 由尼古拉·斯托朗斯基（Nikolay Storonsky）和弗拉德·雅琴科（Vlad Yatsenko）于2015年创立，一直追求雄心勃勃的国际扩张目标，领先于竞争对手挑战者银行，例如 Monzo 和 Starling。该公司去年新增了 1200 万客户，总客户数超过 4500 万。其利息收入在这一期间增长了超过五倍，达到 5 亿英镑。

首席执行官斯托朗斯基表示：“我们的多元化业务模式继续表现出韧性，各个业务部门都实现了强劲增长。” “这种增长是由新产品的推出和数百万新客户的加入推动的。”

尽管在提交监管机构申请英国银行牌照三年多后仍未获得批准，但 *Revolut* 目前正以超过 400 亿美元的估值进行股份出售。该公司上个月宣布计划将总部迁至金丝雀码头（Canary Wharf）最显赫的建筑物之一。

 **Record Profit for UK-based Fintech Revolut**

UK fintech firm *Revolut* reported record profits last year as higher interest rates and an aggressive expansion plan contributed to its success. The London-based company made a pre-tax profit of £438mn in 2023, up from a loss of £25mn the previous year. Its revenues almost doubled to £1.8bn.

Founded by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko in 2015, *Revolut* has pursued an ambitious international expansion, outstripping rival challenger banks such as Monzo and Starling. The company added 12mn customers last year, bringing its total to more than 
45mn. Its interest income climbed more than fivefold to £500mn in the period.

"Our diversified business model continues to demonstrate resilience, with robust growth across various business units," said Storonsky, the chief executive. "This growth was fueled by the introduction of new products and the addition of millions of new customers."

Despite not yet being awarded a UK banking license more than three years after submitting an application to regulators, *Revolut* is currently targeting a valuation of over $40bn in a share sale. The company last month announced plans to move its headquarters to one of the most prominent buildings in Canary Wharf.
