冷藏公司强势上市，美国IPO市场或将复苏

# 冷藏物流公司 Lineage 上市首日表现强劲

**Lineage**，一家由前摩根士丹利银行家亚当·福斯特（Adam Forste）和凯文·马切蒂（Kevin Marchetti）创立的冷藏存储公司，在上市首日表现强劲，股价上涨 3.6%，此前该公司在最大的美国首次公开募股（IPO）中筹集了 44 亿美元。

这家房地产投资信托公司将其发行定价在目标范围的上限，实现了约 180 亿美元的市值。Lineage 运营着一个全球网络，为商业食品客户、制药制造商和宠物食品公司提供冷藏存储设施。在上市首日，Lineage 的 CEO Greg Lehmkuhl 表示，该公司计划使用 IPO 收益主要偿还债务，截至 2023 年末，其净负债约为 109 亿美元。

Lineage 在一个利率上升且对许多房地产投资信托公司（REIT）产生负面影响的市场中表现出色，这要归功于其在市场中的独特地位和**专业化**优势。自 2008 年以西雅图仓库购入开始，Lineage 通过 100 多项收购而发展壮大，其联合创始人们在资本分配和战略决策方面发挥着积极作用。

尽管 2023 年该公司营收增长 8% 至 53 亿美元，但净亏损为 9600 万美元。

 **Lineage**, a cold storage business founded by former Morgan Stanley bankers Adam Forste and Kevin Marchetti, had a strong debut on the stock market with shares rising amo...

- Shares in Lineage rose 3.6% on their first trading day after raising $4.4 billion in the largest US initial public offering (IPO) since September. This signals potential recovery for the new listings market, which is slowly recovering from its worst slowdown in decades.
- The real estate investment trust priced its offering in the top half of its target range and achieved an initial market capitalization of about $18 billion.
- Lineage operates a global network of cold storage facilities for commercial food clients, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and pet food companies. Greg Lehmkuhl, Lineage's CEO, stated that the company plans to use IPO proceeds primarily to pay down its net debt, which stood at about $10.9 billion as of 2e...
- The successful listing by software group OneStream earlier this week also indicates a positive sign for the health of the US listings market. Companies have raised $23.7 billion in non-Spac US IPOs so far this year, marking a 133% increase over the same period in 2023.
- Lineage's niche benefits from "a lot of barriers to entry" and is not as cyclical as less specialized areas of the warehouse industry. Despite rising interest rates since 2022, which have negatively impacted many Reits, Lineage has managed to perform well due to its unique position in the market.
- Former bankers Adam Forste and Kevin Marchetti started Lineage with a warehouse purchase in Seattle in 2008 and grew the business through more than 100 acquisitions. They serve as co-executive chairmen, actively involved in major capital allocation and strategy decisions.
- The company reported revenue of $5.3 billion in 2023, up 8% from $4.9 billion the previous year, but also a net loss of $96 million.
