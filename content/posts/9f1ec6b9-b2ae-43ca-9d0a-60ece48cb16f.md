哈兰德与沃尔夫（Harland & Wolff）老板在紧急融资谈判期间辞职

**哈兰德和沃尔夫首席执行官约翰·伍德辞职，同时紧急资金谈判进行中**

贝尔法斯特船厂（Harland & Wolff）的首席执行官（CEO）在讨论紧急贷款以防止公司倒闭时辞职。这家著名的“泰坦尼克号船厂”正在寻求其现有华尔街贷款机构Riverstone的新2000万英镑贷款，作为其努力以低于当前信贷设施的利率获得新资金的一部分。

约翰·伍德立即开始“休假”，并将由重组专家拉塞尔·道恩斯（Russell Downs）取代，后者将担任公司临时执行董事长。首席执行官的离职预计是从Riverstone获得新贷款的条件之一。

据熟悉该公司情况的消息人士称，这家贝尔法斯特船厂还聘请了罗斯柴尔德（Rothschild）来评估战略选择，这些选择可能包括拆分这家历史悠久的企业。哈兰德和沃尔夫在贝尔法斯特、德文（Appledore）、苏格兰梅希尔（Methil）和阿尼什（Arnish）的四个地点雇用了大约1500人。

哈兰德和沃尔夫已向英国政府寻求2亿英镑的贷款担保，以帮助获得新资金。然而，官员们确认他们不会提供这一担保，因为这将是使用公共资金的不适当方式。该公司在本月早些时候暂停了上市股票交易，并且未能发布审计账目，尽管它赢得了建造新皇家海军船只的16亿英镑合同的一部分。

英国政府致力于在英国各地的造船业发展，官员们正在密切关注哈兰德和沃尔夫的局势。工会对公司如果无法获得新融资可能会发生的职位裁减表示了担忧。

 **Harland & Wolff CEO John Wood Resigns Amid Emergency Funding Talks**  

The chief executive officer (CEO) of Harland & Wolff, a struggling Belfast shipbuilder, has resigned amid discussions for an emergency loan to prevent the company's collapse. The **Titanic shipbuilder** is seeking a new £20mn loan from its existing Wall Street lender, Riverstone, as part of their efforts to secure fresh funding at a lower interest rate than their current credit facility.

John Wood has taken a "leave of absence" with immediate effect and will be replaced by Russell Downs, an expert in restructuring, who is joining the company as interim executive chair. The CEO's departure was expected to be a condition for securing the new loan from Riverstone.

The **Belfast shipbuilder** has also hired Rothschild to assess strategic options that may include breaking up the historic business, according to sources familiar with the company. Harland & Wolff employs approximately 1,500 people across four sites in Belfast, Appledore (Devon), and Methil and Arnish (Scotland).

The UK government has been approached by Harland & Wolff for a £200mn loan guarantee to help secure the new funding. However, officials have confirmed that they will not be providing this guarantee as it would be an inappropriate use of public funds. The company's Aim-listed shares have been suspended since the start of this month and has failed to publish audited accounts despite winning part of a £1.n6bn contract to build new Royal Navy ships.

The government remains committed to shipbuilding across the UK, with officials closely monitoring the situation at Harland & Wolff as it develops. Unions have expressed concerns about potential job losses if the company fails to secure new financing.
