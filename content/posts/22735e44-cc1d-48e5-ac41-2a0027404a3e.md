美国通货膨胀影响需求，汽车经销商加大激励力度

# 美国汽车经销商提高激励措施，以应对高通胀造成的需求下降

美国汽车经销商正在增加回扣、低利率和价格削减等激励措施，因为高通货膨胀导致需求下降。6月，新车平均激励包年同比增长53%。现代、通用汽车和大众等制造商试图在疫情期间供应限制放宽后清理库存。

美国消费者价格指数报告显示，6月新车和二手车成本分别下降0.4%和1.5%，零售销售下降2%。联邦储备银行过去两年的加息终于对经济和消费需求产生了影响。消费者正在抑制购买，尤其是大型耐用品，如汽车，自2021年4月以来，支出显著下降。

5月，新车四年的融资利率达到8.65%的峰值。制造商正在努力处理库存，库存量在过去一年中增加了超过一百万辆。小车和中型车的库存尤其紧张，因为价格敏感的买家由于可负担性问题而缩减规模。

 **Summary of Article:**  
Car dealers in the US are increasing their incentives such as cash back offers, low interest rates, and price cuts due to a decrease in demand caused by high inflation. The average incentive packages offered on new vehicles rose 53% year over year in June. Manufacturers like Hyundai, General Motors, and Volkswagen are trying to clear inventories that have increased since the easing of pandemic-era supply constraints.

The US consumer price index report showed a decrease in the cost of new and used vehicles by 0.4% and 1.5%, respectively, in June. Retail sales also fell by 2%. The Federal Reserve's rate rises over two years have finally impacted the economy and consumer demand. Consumers are holding back on purchases, especially larger durable goods like motor vehicles, with spending falling significantly since April 2021.

Four-year financing rates for new vehicles reached their highest level in May at 8.65%. Manufacturers are struggling to clear high inventory levels that have risen by over a million units in the past year. Inventory is particularly tight for small and mid-size vehicles, as price-conscious buyers downsize due to affordability concerns.

- Car dealers beef up incentives amidst softening demand caused by high inflation.
