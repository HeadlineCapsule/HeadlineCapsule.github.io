美国消费者出现疲态，公司和分析师发出警告

**摘要：**
根据公司、经济学家和投资者的说法，美国消费者出现疲软迹象。在疫情期间，他们对世界最大经济体提供了重要支持。由于收入不足和情绪下降，人们担心消费者力量可能已经达到顶峰。

**要点：**
- 预计美国消费者将收紧支出，因为疫情时期的储蓄正在减少，低收入家庭的信用额度达到极限，就业增长也出现降温。
- 密歇根大学的消费者信心指数因通货膨胀和选举不确定性而下降至11月以来的最低水平。
- 高价格继续影响态度，尤其是低收入人群。
- 一些知名公司警告说，自由支配购买力的需求正在减弱。
- 实时数据表明，消费者开始放缓脚步，转向注重价值的商品，并减少支出。
- 消费者支出放缓可能对美联储的政策制定者来说是一个好消息，因为他们准备讨论降低借贷成本。

**影响：**
可能出现向疫情前趋势的转变，消费者将大部分钱花在服务上，商品制造商面临压力。高收入购物者正在转向折扣店，因为零售商为了提振业务而削减价格。尽管整体情绪放缓，但一些公司仍谨慎乐观。

 **Summary:**  
US consumers are showing signs of flagging, according to companies, economists, and investors. This comes after they played a crucial role in supporting the world's largest economy during the pandemic. Concerns have been raised due to earnings misses and sentiment slowdown, suggesting that consumer strength may have peaked.

**Key Points:**  
- US consumers are expected to rein in spending as pandemic savings deplete, credit limits reach their maximum for lower income households, and employment growth cools down.
- The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest level since November due to inflation and election uncertainty.
- High prices continue to drag down attitudes, particularly among those with lower incomes.
- Several high-profile companies have cautioned about softening demand from discretionary buyers.
- Real-time data suggests consumers are starting to slow down, shifting towards value-oriented goods and spending less.
- A slowdown in consumer spending might be welcome news for policymakers at the Federal Reserve as they prepare to discuss lowering borrowing costs.

**Implications:**  
A potential shift back to pre-Covid trends, with consumers spending most of their money on services and goods manufacturers facing a pinch. Higher-income shoppers are trading down to discount stores as retailers cut prices to boost business. Some companies have reported cautiously positive notes despite the overall sentiment slowdown.
