欧尔班·维克多与普京会面 欧盟发出抗议

**新闻摘要：** 尽管欧盟和北约盟友发出抗议，警告他不代表他们，但匈牙利总理维克多·奥班仍与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京在莫斯科会面。这次会议突显了奥班作为西方最亲俄领导人之一的立场。匈牙利总理抵达莫斯科仅在几天前刚刚对基辅进行了意外访问，这是自2022年普京下令全面入侵乌克兰以来的第一次。

奥班表示，他意识到乌克兰和俄罗斯的立场“相差甚远”。普京要求“彻底并最终结束冲突”，这将需要乌克兰向俄罗斯投降四个东部省份，以及莫斯科之前提到的其他条件。奥班说，他在匈牙利担任为期六个月的欧盟轮值主席国期间，将继续致力于寻找结束战争的办法。

几位欧盟领导人强调，他们没有授权奥班代表他们发言，北约领导层也强调了这一点。德国总理奥拉夫·朔尔茨表示，奥班以匈牙利总理的身份前往莫斯科，而不是代表轮值欧盟主席国。

奥班承认他在前往莫斯科时并不代表欧盟，但表示他可以探索局势。这是自2022年4月奥地利总理卡尔·内哈默失败的尝试以来，欧盟领导人首次访问俄罗斯。匈牙利总理一直采取亲俄立场，推迟对莫斯科的欧盟制裁并反对向基辅提供援助。

 **Article Summary:** Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, despite outcry from EU and NATO allies who warned that he did not represent them. This meeting highlights Orbán's position as one of the west’s most pro-Russian leaders. The Hungarian PM arrived just days after a surprise trip to Kyiv, his first since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in cuyo año 2022.

Orbán stated that he realized Ukraine and Russia's stances were "very far from one another." Putin demanded a “full and final end to the conflict,” which would require Ukraine to surrender four eastern provinces to Russia, along with other conditions previously mentioned by Moscow. Orbán said he would continue working on finding an end to the war during Hungary’s six-month EU presidency.

Several EU leaders stressed that they had not mandated Orbán to speak on their behalf, a position also underlined by NATO's leadership. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that Orbán was in Moscow as the Hungarian PM and not representing the rotating EU presidency.

Orbán acknowledged he did not represent the EU during his trip to Moscow but said he could explore the situation. This is the first visit by an EU leader to Russia since Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer's failed attempt in April 2022. The Hungarian PM has consistently taken a pro-Russia stance, delaying EU sanctions on Moscow and opposing aid to Kyiv.
