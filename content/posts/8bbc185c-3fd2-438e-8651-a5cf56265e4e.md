中国央行为罕见的债券市场干预武装自己

# 中国央行准备进行罕见的债券市场干预，以应对对主权债务泡沫形成的担忧

中国人民银行（PBoC）正在准备进行一次罕见的债券市场干预，因为人们担心中国的主权债务可能形成泡沫。 PBoC 与多家机构达成了协议，向市场借入并出售长期债券，以满足需求并减缓资金流入主权债券的速度。这一干预措施旨在预防突然收益反弹和债券价值下降带来的潜在风险。

PBoC 的行动已经对收益率产生了影响，在宣布临时债券回购或逆回购操作后，收益率上升到了 2.3% 以上。然而，分析师们怀疑中央银行能否无限期地抵制推动收益率下降的结构性力量，因为中国经济正在挣扎，投资选择有限。

考虑到中国的经济增长放缓，重新启动债券市场干预被视为明智之举，尤其是其他工具证明效果不佳。 PBoC 计划在未来几年发行数万亿元人民币的长期债券，需要有效管理债券市场。

央行尚未透露其操作的关键细节，例如时机、规模、成本和频率。专家们警告说，由于中国通货紧缩的环境以及 PBoC 和财政部在债券发行成本上的拉锯战，推动收益率上升将是困难的。

 **Summary:** 
China's central bank, People’s Bank of China (PBoC), is preparing for a rare bond market intervention amid concerns about a bubble forming in the country's sovereign debt. The PBoC has struck deals with several institutions to borrow and sell long-dated bonds into the market, aiming to satisfy demand and slow down the rush of money into sovereign bonds. This intervention is an attempt to prevent potential risks associated with abrupt yield rebound and bond value drops.

The PBoC's actions have already had some effect on yields, which rose above 2.3% after announcing temporary bond repurchases or reverse repo operations. However, analysts doubt the central bank can push back against this demand for bonds indefinitely due to structural forces driving down long-term yields and a struggling economy with limited attractive investment options.

China's revival of bond market intervention is seen as sensible given that other instruments are proving less effective, especially considering the country's economic growth slowdown. The PBoC plans to issue trillions of renminbi more in long-dated bonds over the coming years and needs to manage the bond market effectively.

The central bank has yet to reveal critical details about its operations, such as timing, size, cost, and frequency. Experts caution that pushing up yields will be difficult due to China's deflationary environment and a tug of war between the PBoC and finance ministry over bond issuance costs.
