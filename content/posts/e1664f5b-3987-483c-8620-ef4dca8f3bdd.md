普华永道失去三分之二在大陆客户的会计收入

**摘要：**

PwC 的中国部门 PwC 中天因客户在 mainland 中国上市公司的会计收入大幅减少而受到影响。由于与失败的房地产巨头恒大的审计工作有关，该公司在 2023 年从中国公司审计收入中损失了约三分之二。这种情况导致了裁员、成本削减以及中国审计领域格局的重新塑造，因为主要客户在中伦的潜在处罚中更换了公司。

**要点：**

- 根据 Wind Info 的数据，PwC 中天在过去六个月中从中国内地交易所上市的公司会计收入中损失了约 5.61 亿元人民币（7700 万美元）。
- 由于 PwC 与恒大的审计工作有关，大型客户如中国生命保险和中国铁路集团已更换了公司。
- 客户损失导致 PwC 中天进行裁员和成本削减措施。
- 中国法规要求国有企业和内地上市公司的审计人员每八年和十年轮换一次。然而，随着恒大在 2021 年倒闭以及随后当局对房地产行业的审查，PwC 面临的压力增加了。
- 预计 PwC 将受到处罚，因为中国证券监管机构指控恒大的内地业务在 2019 和 2020 年夸大收入近 800 亿美元，导致该公司被罚款 3570 亿元人民币（577 亿美元）。
- PwC 中天已根据市场需求的变化对其组织结构和人员配备进行了调整。
- 其他四大公司和领先的专业服务公司正在从 PwC 的动荡中受益，聘请前员工并接管客户。

 **Summary of Article:**  
PwC's China unit, PwC Zhong Tian, has experienced a significant loss of accounting revenues from clients listed in mainland China. The firm lost about two-thirds of its 2023 auditing income from Chinese companies on mainland exchanges due to the fallout from its audit of failed property giant Evergrande. This situation led to layoffs, cost cuts, and a reshaping of the audit landscape in China as major clients switched firms amidst potential penalties for PwC.

**Key Points:**  
- **PwC Zhong Tian** lost approximately Rmb561mn ($77mn) out of its total 2023 accounting income from Chinese companies listed on mainland exchanges in the past six months, according to Wind Info.
- Major clients like China Life Insurance and China Railway Group have switched firms due to PwC's involvement with Evergrande audit.
- The client losses resulted in layoffs and cost-cutting measures within PwC Zhong Tian.
- Chinese regulations require state-owned enterprises and mainland-listed companies to retire and rotate auditors every eight and 10 years, respectively. However, the pressure on PwC has increased following Evergrande's collapse in 2021 and subsequent scrutiny of the property industry from authorities.
- The firm is expected to be penalized after China's securities regulator accused Evergrande's mainland business of inflating revenues by almost $80bn over 2019 and 2020, resulting in a fine of Rmb357bn ($57.7bn) for the company.
- PwC Zhong Tian has made adjustments to its organizational structure and staffing levels due to market demand changes.
- Other Big Four firms and leading professional services firms are benefiting from the turbulence at PwC by hiring former employees and taking over clients.
