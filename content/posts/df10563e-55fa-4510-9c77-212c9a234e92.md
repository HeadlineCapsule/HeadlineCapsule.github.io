年轻中国人对提高退休年龄的呼吁感到恼火

# 新闻摘要：

文章讨论了中国共産党会议期间提出的提高退休年龄的提案所引起的争议。这一建议在网上引发了代际辩论，因为人们担心人口下降及其对经济的影响。目前，女性蓝领工人50岁、女性白领员工55岁、所有男性60岁退休的中国低退休年龄被视为对中国老龄化依赖比率的威胁。

据中国社会科学院智库估计，该国基本养老保险基金将在2027年达到峰值，近7万亿元人民币（9830亿美元），随后迅速下降，到2035年将耗尽。政府面临的挑战不仅是确保养老金制度充分资金，而且要使其对所有公民更加公平。

中国社会科学院世界经济与政治研究所的高凌云表示，中国的低退休年龄是生命预期更低、很少有人接受高等教育时确定的。他建议推迟退休有诸多好处，如增加社会福利积累和缓解人口老龄化造成的劳动力短缺。

文章最后指出，根据中国发展和老龄化趋势，改变退休年龄是“不可避免的”，来自潘戈尔机构智库的马奇吉表示。

 **Article Summary:**

The article discusses the controversy surrounding the proposal to raise retirement ages in China, as mentioned during a Communist party meeting. This suggestion has sparked an intergenerational debate online due to concerns about demographic decline and its impact on the economy. The current low retirement age of 50 for female blue-collar workers, 55 for female white-collar employees, and aturday_60 for all males is seen as a threat to China's old-age dependency ratio.

The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences think-tank estimated that the country's basic pension insurance fund would peak in 2027 at nearly Rmb7tn ($983bn) and then decline rapidly, running out by 2035. The government faces challenges not only in ensuring a fully funded pension system but also in making it more equitable for all citizens.

China's low retirement age was set when life expectancy was much lower and few people went into higher education, according to Gao Lingyun from the Institute of World Economics and Politics at CASS. He suggests that delayed retirement offers numerous advantages such as increasing social welfare accumulation and alleviating labor shortages due to population ageing.

The article concludes by stating that changes in retirement ages are "inevitable" given China's development and ageing trends, according to Ma Qiji from the Pangoal Institution think-tank.
