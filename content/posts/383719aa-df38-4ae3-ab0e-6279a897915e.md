谷歌排放量五年内飙升近50% AI用量激增

# Google的温室气体排放激增，人工智能扩张是主因

近年来，随着支持人工智能（AI）系统的数据中心的扩张，Google的温室气体排放量显著增加。该公司五年的污染增长了48%，在2023年达到1430万吨二氧化碳当量。

- Google致力于在2030年实现“净零”排放，但现在受到人工智能系统电力需求的威胁。该公司承认，在投资大型语言模型及其基础设施的同时减少排放是一个复杂的挑战，具有不可预测的环境影响。

尽管排放量增加，Google的首席可持续发展官Kate Brandt重申了公司对2030年目标的承诺，但强调了这一目标的雄心壮志。她还强调了正在进行的减少排放和利用人工智能技术探索气候解决方案的努力。

- Google温室气体排放激增的主要原因是数据中心的能源消耗增加，2023年同比增长37%。此外，该公司供应链排放增加8%，占总排放量（75%）的最大份额。

Google已承诺在2030年实现直接和间接温室气体排放的净零排放，并在每天每时每刻运行于每个网格中碳自由能源。然而，由于一些清洁能源项目终止以及将更多可再生能源项目投入使用的困难，该公司在满足这些目标方面面临挑战。

总之，Google的温室气体排放在最近几年显著增加，这是因为扩大了人工智能系统数据中心。尽管该公司仍致力于在2030年实现净零排放，但人工智能技术不断增长的需求使其在减少排放和达到可再生能源目标方面面临挑战。

 **Google's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Surge Amid AI Expansion**

In recent years, Google has experienced a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to the expansion of its data centers that support artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The company's pollution rose by 48% over five years, reaching 14.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 202amoeba
- Google's commitment to achieving "net zero" emissions by 2030 is now under threat due to the power demands of AI systems. The company acknowledges that reducing emissions while investing in large language models and their infrastructure presents a complex challenge, with unpredictable environmental impacts.
- Despite the rising emissions, Google's Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt reaffirms the company's dedication to its 2030 target but emphasizes the ambitious nature of this goal. She also highlights ongoing efforts in reducing emissions and exploring climate solutions enabled by AI technology.
- The surge in Google's greenhouse gas emissions is primarily attributed to energy consumption at data centers, which increased by 37% year over year in 2023. Additionally, the company's supply chain emissions rose by 8%, representing its largest chunk of total emissions (75%).
- Google has pledged to achieve net zero across both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 while running on carbon-free energy during every hour of every day within each grid it operates. However, the company faced challenges in meeting these targets due to terminations of some clean energy projects and difficulties bringing more renewable power projects online.

In conclusion, Google's greenhouse gas emissions have surged significantly over recent years as a result of expanding its data centers for AI systems. While the company remains committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2030, it faces challenges in reducing emissions and meeting renewable energy targets amidst growing demand from AI technology.
