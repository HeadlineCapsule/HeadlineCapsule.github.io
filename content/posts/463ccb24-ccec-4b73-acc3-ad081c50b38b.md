英国保险公司未能提供客户服务，保费上涨

**英国保险业因客户服务差而受到批评，同时保费不断上涨**

消费者权益组织 Which? 发布的一份报告显示，尽管保费大幅上涨，但英国保险行业的客户服务存在显著问题。该研究发现，在近一半申请房屋、旅行、汽车或宠物保险的客户在理赔过程中遇到过麻烦。常见投诉包括反复要求更新信息和多次提交证明文件。

该报告还揭示了一个令人担忧的趋势：因事故而遭受严重影响的个人在理赔处理中遇到困难的可能性几乎是其他人的一倍。鉴于去年金融行为监管局（FCA）引入的《消费者职责》旨在保护弱势群体，这一点尤其令人担忧。

Which? 政策和宣传总监罗西奥·科查（Rocio Concha）表示，消费者要么被“敲竹杠”，要么面临高得离谱的保费。该消费者权益组织呼吁 FCA 更好地监督保险公司理赔处理实践，强调需要对未能达到预期标准的公司采取有意义的行动。

该报告基于对在过去三年中申请过保险理赔的 3000 多名消费者的调查以及金融监察员服务（FOS）收到的 8000 多份投诉的分析。FCA 对这些反馈做出了回应，称其规则要求公平、及时地处理理赔，且不得设置障碍。

英国保险行业面临着各种挑战，包括更换车辆成本、零部件和劳动力费用上涨（尤其是电动汽车），以及极端天气事件数量的增加。工党在其选举宣言中承诺解决“飙升的汽车保险费用”。

 **UK Insurance Industry Criticized for Poor Customer Service Amid Rising Premiums**

A recent report from consumer group Which? has highlighted significant issues with customer service in the UK insurance industry, despite substantial increases in premium costs. The study found that nearly half of customers making claims on home, travel, motor or pet insurance policies experienced problems during the process. Common complaints included repeated requests for updates and multiple submissions of supporting paperwork.

The report also revealed a concerning trend: individuals severely impacted by incidents leading to their claim were almost twice as likely to face difficulties with claims handling. This is particularly troubling given increased obligations under the Consumer Duty, introduced last year by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to protect vulnerable customers.

Which? director of policy and advocacy Rocio Concha stated that consumers are being "ripped off" either through inadequate claims handling or unjustifiably high premiums. The consumer group has called on the FCA to improve supervision of insurers' claims handling practices, emphasizing the need for meaningful action against firms falling short of expectations.

The report is based on a survey of over 3,000 consumers who made an insurance claim in the past three years and analysis of more than eight thousand complaints received by the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). The FCA has responded to these findebacklashes, stating that their rules require fair and timely claims handling without barriers.

The UK insurance industry faces challenges such as rising replacement car costs, vehicle parts, labor expenses, especially for electric vehicles, and an increasing number of extreme weather events. The Labour party has also pledged to address the "soaring cost of car insurance" in its election manifesto.
