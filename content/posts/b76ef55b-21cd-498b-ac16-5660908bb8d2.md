尽管美国管制，英伟达今年仍将从中国AI芯片市场赚取120亿美元

# 尽管面临出口管制，英伟达（Nvidia）预计今年将在中国销售约 120 亿美元的人工智能（AI）芯片。

尽管美国出口管制影响了该公司在世界最大半导体市场之一的业务运营，但英伟达仍计划交付超过 100 万颗 H20 芯片，这些芯片旨在规避美国向中国客户销售 AI 处理器的限制。这一数字是当地竞争对手华为预计销售的 Ascend 910B 产品数量的两倍。

拜登政府实施了出口管制，旨在限制高性能芯片流向中国，因为担心它们可能被用于军事应用。这种 AI 芯片短缺影响了中国科技公司与 OpenAI 和微软等美国公司竞争的能力。每颗 H20 芯片售价在 1.2 万美元到 1.3 万美元之间，这表明英伟达的收入可能超过其 2024 年 1 月终了财年整个中国业务 103 亿美元的收入。

尽管出口管制带来挑战，但英伟达的 H20 芯片在中国客户中很受欢迎，因为它们具有竞争力，而且与华为的 Ascend 910B 等当地替代产品相比，内存性能更优异。大多数中国 AI 公司都是在英伟达的生态系统中构建其模型的，因此转换到其他平台将成本高、耗时长。

在出口管制实施之前，英伟达在中国的销售额占其总收入的近四分之一；然而，由于美国科技公司正在建设更大的 AI 系统，这一数字今年可能接近 10%。

 **Summary of Article:**  
Nvidia is projected to generate approximately $12 billion in sales from its artificial intelligence (AI) chips in China this year despite US export controls that have impacted the company's business operations within one of the world's largest semiconductor markets. The Silicon Valley-based chipmaker plans to deliver over 1 million H20 chips, which are designed to circumvent US restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers. This figure is nearly double what local rival Huawei is expected to sell of its China-made Ascend 
910B product.  

The Biden administration has imposed export controls aimed at limiting the flow of powerful chips to China, fearing their potential use in military applications. This shortage of AI chips has affected Chinese tech companies' ability to compete with US-based firms like OpenAI and Microsoft. Each H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting that Nvidia could generate more than its entire China business revenue of $10.3 billion in the financial year ending January 2024.

Despite challenges posed by export controls, Nvidia's H20 chips are proving popular among Chinese customers due to their competitiveness and superior memory performance compared to local alternatives like Huawei's Ascend 910B. Most Chinese AI companies have built their models on top of Nvidia's ecosystem, making a switch costly and time-consuming.

Nvidia's sales in China accounted for more than a quarter of its total revenues before the imposition of export controls; however, this year it could be closer to 10% due to significant growth from US tech companies building larger AI systems.
