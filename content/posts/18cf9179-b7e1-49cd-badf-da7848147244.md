前董事指控受Tether支持的加密货币集团Northern Data欺诈

根据所提供的信息，似乎有指控称北方数据公司存在财务不当行为、逃税以及潜在的会计欺诈。举报人声称该公司管理层参与非法活动，例如伪造财务报表以欺骗投资者和审计师。

原告指控北方数据自 2020 年 12 月以来多次通过融资筹集资金，随后发布夸大的新闻稿以推动股价上涨。该公司对比特币销售和泰达币股东贷款的依赖在安永会计师事务所 2022 年财务审计报告中被标记为对其作为持续经营实体的能力存在重大不确定性。

举报人阿鲁什·蒂莱纳坦（北方数据联合创始人兼首席执行官）和古尔斯根·卡玛（前北美首席财务官）声称，他们在试图揭露所指控的欺诈行为时遭到报复而被解雇。该公司已将审计师从安永会计师事务所改为位于斯图加特的小型律师事务所莱布哈特＆科勒根。

北方数据对这些指控的回应是，投诉部分包含受律师-客户特权和工作成果原则保护的机密和特权通信。该公司成功地请愿法院对投诉的部分内容进行保密，但原告保留对该密封命令提出质疑的权利。

鉴于此案对北方数据财务状况和声誉的潜在影响，投资者和利益相关者必须密切关注案件的发展。

 Based on the information provided, it appears that there are allegations against Northern Data regarding financial misconduct, tax evasion, and potential accounting fraud. The whistleblowers claim that the company's management was involved in illegal activities such as falsifying financials to deceive investors and auditors.

The plaintiffs allege that Northern Data raised funds multiple times since December 2020 through capital raises, followed by hyped-up press releases aiming to drive up the stock price. The company's reliance on bitcoin sales and a Tether shareholder loan has been flagged as a material uncertainty about its ability to continue as a going concern in KPMG's audit report for 2022 financials.

The whistleblowers, Aroosh Thillainathan (Northern Data’s co-founder and CEO) and Gulsen Kama (former North America CFO), claim they were terminated in retaliation for their attempts to expose the alleged fraudulent activities. The company has since changed its auditor from KPMG to Liebhart & Kollegen, a small law firm based in Stuttgart.

Northern Data's response to these allegations is that portions of the complaint contain confidential and privileged communications protected by attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. The company has successfully petitioned the court to have parts of the complaint redacted, but the plaintiffs are reserving their right to challenge this sealing order.

It is essential for investors and stakeholders to closely monitor any developments in this case as it unfolds, given its potential impact on Northern Data's financial position and reputation.
