保罗·卡加梅在卢旺达大选中获胜后巩固权力

# 翻译：

**摘要：**
卢旺达总统保罗·卡加梅在星期一的选举中获得了压倒性的胜利，得票率为99%，远超其他两名鲜为人知的对手，进一步巩固了他对国家的统治。这是他自2003年首次当选以来第五次担任总统。

支持者称赞卡加梅为卢旺达带来了发展，并在图西族遭到种族灭绝的创伤后培养了一种民族认同感；而批评者则质疑官方的经济数据，并指控他支持邻国刚果民主共和国（DRC）的叛军。这次选举投票率较低，仅为98%，两名候选人得票微不足道。

由于包括Victoire Ingabire和Bernard Ntaganda在内的著名反对派人士被禁止参加竞选，卡加梅对民主的承诺受到质疑。批评者认为，卢旺达没有自由和公平的选举；而卡加梅则辩称，他长期执政的原因是种族灭绝的特殊情况。

人权组织对反对党受到限制、持不同政见者遭到骚扰以及涉嫌杀戮等问题表示关切。尽管受到这些批评，西方首都仍将支持卡加梅，因为卢旺达是该地区的关键盟友。

 **Summary:**  
Rwandan President Paul Kagame secured a landslide victory in Monday's election with 99% of votes after two lesser-known opponents were prevented from running, reinforcing his dominance over the country. This marks his fifth term as president since first being elected in 2amo.

Kagame is credited by supporters for bringing development to Rwanda and fostering a sense of identity after the devastating genocide against Tutsis, while critics question official economic figures and accuse him of backing rebels in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The election saw low turnout at 98%, with only two candidates receiving minimal votes.

Kagame's commitment to democracy has been called into question due to the prevention of prominent opponents from contesting, including Victoire Ingabire and Bernard Ntaganda. Critics argue that there is no free and fair election in Rwanda, while Kagame defends his long-standing rule by citing unique circumstances surrounding the genocide.

Human rights groups have raised concerns about restrictions on opposition parties, harassment of dissidents, and alleged killings. Despite these criticisms, western capitals are likely to maintain their support for Kagame due to Rwanda's status as a key ally in the region.
