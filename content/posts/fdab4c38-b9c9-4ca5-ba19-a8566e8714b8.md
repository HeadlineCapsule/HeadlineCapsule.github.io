拜登称辩论是一场“糟糕的比武”并拒绝退出竞选呼声

尽管批评者的压力越来越大，而且人们对他的年龄和健康状况存在担忧，尤其是经过与唐纳德·特朗普的辩论之后，乔·拜登仍坚定地继续他的总统竞选活动。在全国范围内的民意调查和关键州的民意调查中都落后，但拜登仍然坚定不移，并承诺在共和党全国代表大会和奥运会期间为广告投入大量资金。

虽然一些民主党领导人私下呼吁他暂停竞选活动，但像卡玛拉·哈里斯、加文·纽瑟姆和格雷琴·惠特默这样的其他人则公开忠于拜登的候选人。然而，也有著名的民主党人不愿意与拜登一起出现在舞台上，在威斯康星州就可以看到这一点，塔米·巴尔德温没有在他竞选访问期间加入他。

该文章没有直接讨论2024年美国选举将如何影响个人；然而，它强调了围绕乔·拜登即将到来的总统大选中与唐纳德·特朗普竞争的候选资格的持续辩论和不确定性。

 The passage discusses Joe Biden's determination to continue his presidential campaign despite mounting pressure from critics and concerns about his age and health, particularly after a debate with Donald Trump. Despite trailing in public opinion polls both nationwide and in battleground states, Biden remains defiant and has committed significant funds for advertising during the Republican National Convention and the Olympics.

While some Democratic leaders have privately called for him to suspend his campaign, others like Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and Gretchen Whitmer remain publicly loyal to Biden's candidacy. However, there are also prominent Democrats who are hesitant to share the stage with Biden, as seen in Wisconsin where Tammy Baldwin did not join him during a campaign visit.

The passage does not directly address how the 2024 US election will affect individuals; however, it highlights the ongoing debate and uncertainty surrounding Joe Biden's candidacy for the upcoming presidential race against Donald Trump.
