肯尼亚总统在大规模抗议后解雇大部分内阁成员

# 肯尼亚总统在大规模抗议后解雇大部分内阁成员

- 肯尼亚总统威廉·鲁托（William Ruto）在青年领导的抗议活动迫使他撤回有争议的财务法案后，解雇了几乎整个内阁。
- 上个月，由于人们反对拟议中的增税，发生了大规模抗议活动，在人权组织指控至少有[数量]人因参与抗议而死亡后，鲁托放弃了增税计划，并宣布了政府开支削减计划，首先从其昂贵的官僚机构着手。
- 政治评论员帕特里克·加塔拉（Patrick Gathara）认为，这些行动代表了总统鲁托为回应抗议者的要求而做出的系列让步。
- 在他的讲话中，鲁托承诺将组建一个新的政府，专注于实施“紧迫且不可逆”的措施，以解决社会问题并管理该国的债务负担。
- 批评人士指出，虽然鲁托指责上一届政府借贷过度，但他曾在乌胡鲁·肯雅塔（Uhuru Kenyatta）的政府中担任副总统近十年之久。

- 穆迪（Moody's）最近将肯尼亚的评级下调至Caa1，表明由于国际货币基金组织（IMF）提出的财政整合和雄心勃勃的收入动员计划，该国存在非常高的信用风险。

- In response to the public outcry and violent demonstrations, Ruto abandoned the tax increases and announced plans for government expenditure cuts, starting with its own costly bureaucracy.
- Political commentator Patrick Gathara suggests that these actions represent a series of concessions made by President Ruto in response to protester demands.
- In his address, Ruto pledged to form a new government focused on implementing "urgent and irreversible" measures to tackle social issues and manage the country's debt burden.
- Critics have pointed out that while blaming the previous administration for overborrowing, President Ruto was deputy president under Uhuru Kenyatta for nearly a decade.
- The crisis in Kenya highlights the challenge faced by many African states: balancing external debt obligations with maintaining public support at home. Carlos Lopes from the University of Cape Town emphasizes that prioritizing debt servicing may not be the best approach.
- Moody's recently downgraded its rating for Kenya to Caa1, indicating very high credit risk due to concerns over fiscal consolidation and ambitious revenue mobilization programs outlined by the IMF.
