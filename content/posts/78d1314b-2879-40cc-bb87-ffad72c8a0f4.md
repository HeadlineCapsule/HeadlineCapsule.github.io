人工智能助力突破天气和气候预报

**人工智能在天气预报方面的突破**

谷歌和欧洲中期天气预报中心（ECMWF）的研究人员开发了一个名为NeuralGCM的新模型，该模型结合了机器学习和传统大气物理模型，以改善长期天气预报。这种混合方法在准确预测气候趋势和极端天气事件（例如气旋）方面表现出比仅使用人工智能或传统方法更有效的承诺。

**要点：**

1. NeuralGCM是一个融合机器学习和成熟的大气物理模型以提高长期预报准确性的模型。
2. 这种混合方法在速度、准确性和计算效率方面优于传统的天气和气候预测工具以及仅使用人工智能的模型。
3. NeuralGCM能够在24小时内利用谷歌定制的AI张量处理单元生成70,000个模拟日，而一个可比的模型需要显著更多的资源。
4. 研究人员认为，机器学习和基于物理学的模型的结合也可以应用于其他领域，例如材料发现和工程设计。
5. NeuralGCM是开放获取的，谷歌已经公开了其代码，以供进一步开发和改进。
6. 尽管取得了成功，但仍有需要改进的地方，包括估计二氧化碳对全球地表温度的影响并模拟前所未有的气候。

**影响：**

人工智能与基于物理学的模型在天气预报方面的成功集成可能导致跨各个领域的预测进步，这些领域依赖于准确的模拟，例如材料发现和工程设计。NeuralGCM的开放获取性质也鼓励科学界中的协作和进一步开发。

 **Artificial Intelligence Breakthrough in Weather Forecasting**

Researchers from Google and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) have developed a new model called NeuralGCM, which combines machine learning with traditional atmospheric physics models to improve long-range weather forecasting. This hybrid approach has shown promising results in accuramoetting climate trends and extreme weather events such as cyclones more effectively than AI-only or conventional methods alone.

**Key Points:**

1. NeuralGCM is a model that merges machine learning with established atmospheric physics models to enhance long-range forecasting accuracy.
2. The hybrid approach outperforms traditional weather and climate prediction tools, as well as AI-only models in terms of speed, accuracy, and computing power efficiency.
3. NeuralGCM was able to generate 70,000 simulation days within 24 hours using Google's customized AI tensor processing units, while a comparable model required significantly more resources.
4. The researchers suggest that this combination of machine learning and physics-based models could be applied in other fields such as materials discovery and engineering design.
5. NeuralGCM is open access, with its code made available by Google for further development and improvement.
6. Despite the successes, there are still areas to improve upon, including estimating CO₂ impacts on global surface temperatures and simulating unprecedented climates.

**Implications:**

The successful integration of machine learning with physics-based models in weather forecasting could lead to advancamoetting predictions across various fields that rely on accurate simulations, such as materials discovery and engineering design. The open access nature of NeuralGCM also encourages collaboration and further development within the scientific community.
