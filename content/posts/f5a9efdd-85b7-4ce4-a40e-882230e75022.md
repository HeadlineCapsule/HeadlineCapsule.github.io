主动型债券ETF蓬勃发展，总流入有望达到1万亿美元/年

# 2024 年主动债券 ETF 流入创纪录

主动债券交易所交易基金 (ETF) 行业正在经历创纪录的流入，到 2024 年底有望达到 1 万亿美元。推动这一浪潮的是零售投资者和年轻投资者的参与，以及简化 ETF 发行程序的《201 号规则》变更。

仅在 6 月份，主动管理固定收益 ETF 就吸引了 70 亿美元投资，将 2024 年上半年的总金额提高到 410 亿美元。这一数字超过了 2023 年创下的 330 亿美元的纪录，是美国第三大 ETF 发行商 State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) 的重要里程碑。

虽然大多数投资者将 ETF 与被动权益策略联系起来，但主动债券 ETF 在美国 9 万亿美元的 ETF 行业中吸引了越来越多的资金。SSGA SPDR 美洲研究部负责人 Matt Bartolini 相信，随着这些基金的发展和吸引更多投资者的兴趣，这种势头将继续增长。

主动管理债券 ETF 还受益于其与被动同行相比更高的平均费用。根据投资公司研究所 (ICI) 的数据，主动管理产品的平均费用大约是被动产品的三倍。尽管如此，由于投资者寻求更好的回报和较低的费用，主动型共同基金仍在经历显著的资金外流。

彭博美国综合债券指数（又称“Agg”）已经近四年没有达到历史新高。这种缺乏表现可能正在推动投资者对主动债券 ETF 感兴趣，因为它们有机会超过这一基准。

总的来说，美国 ETF 在 6 月吸引了超过 800 亿美元，2024 年上半年达到 4110 亿美元。2021 年全年创纪录的流入额刚过 9110 亿美元。由于下半年通常有更高的流入，如果美联储降息并推动年末“圣诞老人拉升行情”，美国 ETF 有可能实现首个 1 万亿美元流入年份。

总之，由于零售投资者、年轻投资者的参与、监管变化以及潜在更高的回报，2024 年主动债券 ETF 经历了前所未有的增长。随着行业接近其首个 1 万亿美元流入年份，这一趋势可能会持续下去。

 # Article Summary: Record Inflows for Active Bond ETFs in 2024

The **active bond Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)** industry is experiencing record inflows, with the potential to reach a total of $1 trillion by the end of 2024. This surge has been driven by retail interest and younger investors' participation, as well as a **201amo rule change** that streamlined ETF launches.

In June alone, actively managed fixed-income ETFs attracted $7 billion in investments, bringing the total for the first half of 2024 to $41 billion. This figure surpasses the previous record set in 2023 at $33 billion and is a significant milestone for State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the third-largest US ETF issuer.

While most investors associate ETFs with passive equity strategies, active bond ETFs have been capturing an increasing share of new money in the $9 trillion US ETF industry. Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at SSGA, believes this momentum will continue to grow as these funds develop longer track records and attract more investor interest.

Actively managed bond ETFs have also benefited from their higher average fees compared to passive counterparts. According to the Investment Company Institute (ICI), actively managed offerings are approximately three times more expensive on average than passive ones. Despite this, active mutual funds continue to experience significant outflows as investors seek better returns and lower fees from ETFs.

The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond index, also known as the "Agg," has not seen an all-time high in nearly four years. This lack of performance may be driving investors' interest in active bond ETFs that offer a chance to outperform this benchmark.

Overall, US ETFs have attracted more than $80 billion in June and reached $411 billion through the first six months of 2n24. The calendar-year record is just over $911 billion in 2021. With higher flows typically occurring in the second half of the year, there's a possibility that US ETFs could achieve their first $1 trillion flow year if the Federal Reserve cuts rates and fuels a late-year "Santa Claus Rally."

In conclusion, active bond ETFs are experiencing unprecedented growth in 2024 due to retail interest, younger investors' participation, regulatory changes, and their potential for higher returns. This trend may continue as the industry approaches its first $1 trillion flow year.
