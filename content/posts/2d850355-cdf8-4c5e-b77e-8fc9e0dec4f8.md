卡玛拉·哈里斯获得足够的代表支持，赢得民主党提名

**卡玛拉·哈里斯获得足够的代表支持，赢得民主党提名** 

美国副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯获得了她的政党足够的代表支持，赢得了民主党总统提名的提名。她承诺为美国人提供一个“更光明的未来”，与共和党候选人唐纳德·特朗普提出的“混乱、恐惧和仇恨”形成对比。

在美国总统乔·拜登放弃连任并支持她作为民主党总统候选人的第二天，哈里斯超过了这一门槛，从而改变了2024年的选情。哈里斯竞选团队报告说，在拜登支持她的那一天，有888,000多人捐款，其中60%是这个选举周期的新捐助者。

哈里斯的参选预计将激励女性、年轻选民以及黑人、西班牙裔等少数族裔群体。然而，自从上个月拜登的辩论表现和试图暗杀他的企图之后，特朗普在民意调查中一直保持领先优势，因此哈里斯要想取得进展仍具挑战性。

尽管得到了总统拜登的支持，但他的部分竞选顾问认为哈里斯“与拜登一样糟糕，甚至更差”。他们认为，她的提名不会改变比赛的动态。

 **Kamala Harris secures enough delegates for Democratic nomination**  

US Vice President Kamala Harris has secured enough delegates from her party to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. She pledged to offer Americans a "brighter future" compared with the "chaos, fear and hate" proposed by Republican nominee Donald Trump. 

Harris passed the threshold on the first full day since President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid and endorsed her for the Democratic presidential nomination, shaking up the 2024 race. The Harris campaign reported that more than 888,000 people donated in a single day after she was endorsed by Biden, with over 60% of them being new to this election cycle.

Harris's entry into the race is expected to energize women, young voters, and minority groups such as Black and Hispanic communities. However, it may still be challenging for her to make gains against Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has built a solid edge in polling since Biden's debate performance last month and after surviving an assassination attempt.

Despite the endorsement from President Biden, some of his campaign advisers believe that Harris is "as bad, if not worse" than him. They argue that her nomination will not change anything in terms of the race dynamics.
