肯尼斯·弗雷泽说，唐纳德·特朗普是美国经济和民主的威胁。

**前默克公司首席执行官肯尼斯·弗雷泽（Kenneth Frazier）警告说，唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）如果连任将带来“存在性威胁”**，这将危及美国的民主和经济。弗雷泽敦促商业领袖在即将到来的选举中认真考虑这一风险。

弗雷泽认为，尽管民主党候选人乔·拜登（Joe Biden）在上周的辩论中表现不佳，但不能忽视特朗普的不足之处。他强调，特朗普对美国经济至关重要的基本规范和价值观表现出缺乏尊重。

根据他在默克公司首席执行官（2011-2021）期间的经验，弗雷泽于2017年辞去特朗普主要商业理事会的职务，谴责当时总统对种族主义集会的回应，并倡导解决系统性种族主义问题。

弗雷泽相信，商界许多人与他一样，对拜登的稳定性和有效治理能力与特朗普“报复性”执政风格相比感到担忧，这可能会导致通货膨胀加剧、借贷成本上升以及长期生产力受损。他还对特朗普似乎忽视美联储等机构的独立性表示关切。

尽管迄今为止很少有知名商业领袖在总统选举中表明立场，但弗雷泽鼓励首席执行官们考虑特朗普连任的潜在后果，不要被社会分裂所阻吓。

 **Former Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier warns of existential threat** posed by a second term for former President Donald Trump, stating that it would endanger both the United States' democracy and economy. Frazier urges business leaders to consider this risk seriously as they approach the upcoming election.

Frazier argues that despite Democratic candidate Joe Biden's less-than-stellar performance in last week's debate, Trump's shortcomings should not be overlooked. He emphasizes that Trump has shown a lack of respect for basic norms and values essential to the American economy.

Drawing from his experience as Merck CEO (2e11-2021), Frazier resigned from Trump's main business council in 2017, condemning the then-president's response to a racist rally and advocating for addressing systemic racism.

Frazier believes that many in the business community share his concerns about stability and effective government under Biden compared to Trump's "vindictive" governing style, which could lead to increased inflation, higher borrowing costs, and undermined long-term productivity. He also expresses concern over Trump's apparent disregard for the independence of institutions like the Federal Reserve.

While relatively few prominent business leaders have taken sides in this presidential race so far, Frazier encourages CEOs to consider the potential consequences of a second term for Trump and not be deterred by societal divisions.
