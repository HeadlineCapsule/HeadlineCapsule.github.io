CrowdStrike 实施新检查以避免另一场全球 IT 停机事件

**众击**，总部位于德克萨斯州的网络安全公司，已宣布计划实施新检查，以防止类似上周事件的全局IT停机。有缺陷的软件更新导致了各行各业的大范围中断，包括航空公司和零售商。

关键措施包括：

1. **改进的内部测试** - 在部署之前识别潜在问题。
2. **分阶段部署策略** 对于更新，逐步部署它们以减少错误导致大规模影响的风险。

有缺陷的更新影响了大约850万台Windows设备（所有Windows机器的不到1%），导致飞机停飞和医院预约中断等严重中断。该公司的首席执行官乔治·库茨（George Kurtz）被美国国会传唤，解释众击在被称为“历史上最大的IT停机”事件中的作用。

对事件的初步审查表明，由于内容验证器中的错误，软件更新中的未检测到的错误通过了验证。在众击发现并解决问题之前，数百万台机器在90分钟内受到影响。

众击还警告客户，网络犯罪分子试图利用中断来分发恶意文件，并提供了一个网络域名列表，这些域名冒充其品牌。

 **CrowdStrike**, the Texas-based cyber security company, has announced plans to implement new checks in order to prevent another global IT outage similar to last week's incident. The faulty software update caused widespread disruption across various industries including airlines and retailers.

Key measures include:
1. **Improved internal testing** - To identify potential issues before deployment.
2. **Staggered deployment strategy** for updates, gradually deploying them to reduce the risk of large-scale impact from errors.

The faulty update affected approximately 8.5 million Windows devices (less than 1% of all Windows machines), causing significant disruptions such as grounded planes and interrupted hospital appointments. The company's CEO, George Kurtz, was summoned by the US Congress to explain CrowdStrike's role in what has been called "the largest IT outage in history."

The preliminary review of the incident revealed that an undetected error in the software update passed validation due to a bug in the content validator. It took about ninety minutes for millions of machines to be affected before CrowdStrike discovered and addressed the issue.

CrowdStrike also warned customers about potential threats from cyber criminals attempting to exploit the disruption by distributing malicious files, providing a list of internet domains impersonating their brand as part of this warning.
