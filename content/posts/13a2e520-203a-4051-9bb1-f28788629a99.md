英国应该惩罚接受国家援助却在国外上市的初创企业，游说团体表示。

**英国金融** 游说团体建议惩罚接受国家援助但海外上市或将业务转移到国外的初创企业。拟议措施旨在阻止企业离开英国，尤其是流向美国的趋势。

政府被敦促考虑由纳税人资助的早期阶段增长公司支持方式，这涉及到双方承诺，如果受助方在英国境外上市或转移有价值的业务，则需要偿还资金。游说团体认为，将纳税人支持与未来使用英国公共市场和在英国境内运营的承诺联系起来的理由很充分。

这些提议是在人们担心英国成为“孵化器经济”的情况下提出的，初创企业在纽约上市，被外国公司收购，或依赖海外投资者。保守党和工党都支持阻止这种现象的呼吁，因为它可能导致失业、知识产权转移和其他业务离开英国。

英国金融还建议政府为高增长公司提供更多慷慨的支持，并扩大现有的融资计划，将受监管的金融科技企业包括在内。该游说团体的董事总经理建议，可以考虑对受国家援助但五到七年内离开的公司征收税收处罚，这符合美国和法国等国家的干预主义做法。

 **UK Finance** lobby group suggests penalising start-ups for accepting state aid but listing abroad or moving operations overseas. The proposed measures aim to halt the flow of businesses leaving the UK, particularly towards the US. 

The government is urged to consider ways in which taxpayer-funded supports for early-stage growth companies involve a two-way commitment and become repayable if recipients list or move valuable operations outside the UK. The lobby group argues that there should be a strong case for linking taxpayer support to future commitments of using UK public markets and operating within the country.

The proposals come amid concerns about Britain becoming an "incubator economy," with start-ups listing in New York, being acquired by foreign companies or relying on overseas investors. The Conservative and Labour parties have supported calls to halt this phenomenon, which can lead to job losses, intellectual property transfers, and other operations moving out of the UK.

UK Finance also recommends more generous government support for high-growth companies and expanding existing funding schemes to include regulated fintech businesses. The lobby group's managing director suggests that tax penalties could be considered for companies benefiting from state aid but leaving within a five-to-seven year period, following the more interventionist approaches of countries like the US and France.
