杰伊·鲍威尔表示，他越来越相信美国通货膨胀正朝着2%的目标前进。

**美联储主席杰伊·鲍威尔（Jay Powell）在华盛顿经济俱乐部的演讲中表达了对通货膨胀向2%目标收敛的日益增强的信心。** 这种乐观态度基于最近的消费者价格指数报告，这些报告显示价格压力正在缓解，并且过去三个月的价格增长速度“相当不错”。

美联储一直在考虑降息，预计将在9月会议上降低借贷成本。鲍威尔没有对时机发表评论，但提到政策决定将“一次会议一次地”做出。美国的失业率仍然保持在低位，为4.1%，而工资增长已放缓，月度就业增长也出现温和下滑，导致官员们将风险描述为“两面”。

鲍威尔还表示，“硬着陆”的情况不太可能或不可能发生，中性利率自大流行前可能已经上升。这表明利率将高于以前的水平。

 **Summary of Article:**
The US Federal Reserve's chair, Jay Powell, expressed growing confidence in inflation moving towards its 2% target during his speech at the Economic Club of Washington. This optimism is based on recent consumer price index reports showing easing price pressures and a "pretty good pace" of price growth over the last three months.

The Fed has been considering cutting interest rates, with expectations that it will lower borrowing costs when it meets in September. Powell did not comment on the timing but mentioned policy decisions would be made "meeting by meeting." The US unemployment rate remains low at 4.1%, while wage growth has slowed and monthly job gains have moderated, leading officials to frame risks as "two-sided."

Powell also stated that a hard landing scenario is not likely or probable, with the neutral interest rate probably having increased since before the pandemic. This suggests rates will settle at a higher level than previously seen.
