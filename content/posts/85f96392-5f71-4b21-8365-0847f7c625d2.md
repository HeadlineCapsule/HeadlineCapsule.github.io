新西兰总理发誓要点名批评中国进行间谍活动

# 新西兰总理克里斯托弗·豪森（Christopher Luxon）誓言要点名并羞辱中国进行间谍活动：

在新西兰总理克里斯托弗·豪森接受《金融时报》采访时宣布，新西兰将越来越多地披露中国间谍活动的案例。这一策略旨在提高企业界对中国所构成的安全威胁的认识，也反映了美国、英国、加拿大和澳大利亚等国所采取的方法。

豪森强调了情报机构公开这些案件的重要性，以便建立对这些问题和威胁的认识。他认为，揭露间谍活动对于维护安全是必要的。此前，新西兰与华盛顿和堪培拉一起指控北京对澳大利亚进行了网络攻击，而豪森政府也在2021年透露了类似的新西兰议会的网络攻击。

总理强调了透明度的力量，并提到美国在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前透露了有关俄罗斯建立部队的情报。他强调了欧亚地区发生的事件对印太地区的影响，并引用了朝鲜向俄罗斯提供武器作为严重关切的例子。

虽然将中国视为印太地区的战略竞争对手，豪森表示新西兰正在追求一种平衡的策略，包括在贸易和可再生能源等领域与中国合作。然而，他也表达了在必要时批评中国以避免经济胁迫的愿意。

豪森对南中国海的第二托马斯礁（Second Thomas Shoal）表示担忧，在那里，中国一直在对菲律宾采取强硬战术。他强调了维护国际法和航行自由对像新西兰这样的贸易国的重要性。豪森还提到，惠灵顿希望今年完成与马尼拉的“访问部队地位协议”，允许新西兰向菲律宾部署军事资产。

总理表示愿意参与联合军事演习，并可能通过台湾海峡进行航行自由行动，作为该国的安全优先事项。他还提到，新西兰有兴趣为Aukus做出贡献，这是一个由美国、英国和澳大利亚之间的协议，专注于诸如核动力潜艇等先进技术。

 **New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon** vows to name and shame China over espionage activities:

In an interview with the Financial Times, New Zealand's Prime Minister **Christopher Luxon** announced that his country would be increasingly disclosing cases of Chinese espionage. This strategy aims to raise awareness within the business community about security threats posed by China and mirrors approaches taken by countries such as the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.

Luxon emphasized the importance of intelligence agencies being more open about these cases in order to build literacy around them as issues and threats. He believes that shedding light on espionage activities is necessary for maintaining security. This comes after New Zealand joined Washington and Canberra in accusing Beijing of conducting cyber attacks against Australia, with Luxon's government also revealing similar attacks against New Zealand's parliament in 2021.

The Prime Minister highlighted the power of transparency by referencing how the US revealed intelligence about Russia building up forces before invading Ukraine. He stressed that events in the Euro-Atlantic region have an impact on the Indo-Pacific, citing North Korea's provision of weapons to Russia as a serious concern.

While viewing China as a strategic competitor in the Indo-Pacific, Luxon stated that New Zealand is pursuing a balanced strategy involving cooperation with China on trade and renewable energy, among other areas. However, he also expressed his willingness to criticize China when necessary over concerns of retaliatory economic coercion.

Luxon voiced concern about the Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea, where China has been using aggressive tactics against the Philippines. He emphasized the importance of upholding international law and freedom of navigation for a trading country like New Zealand. Luxon also mentioned that Wellington hopes to complete a "status of visiting forces agreement" with Manila this year, allowing New Zealand to deploy military assets to the Philippines.

The Prime Minister expressed openness towards participating in joint military exercises and potentially conducting freedom of navigation operations through the Taiwan Strait as part of his country's security priorities. He also mentioned that New Zealand is interested in contributing to Aukus, an agreement between the US, UK, and Australia focused on advanced technologies such as nuclear-propelled submarines.
