谷歌联合创始人投资研究迷幻非洲灌木的生物科技公司

**谷歌联合创始人谢尔盖·布林的非营利性资金支持迷幻药物研究** 

谷歌联合创始人谢尔盖·布林支持开发一种源自非洲灌木的致幻剂作为精神健康治疗方法。他的非营利性投资工具 Catalyst4 承诺在总融资额为 2500 万美元的轮次中提供约 1500 万美元，用于迷幻初创公司 Soneira。这家生物科技公司正在启动临床试验，以调查伊波加因（ibogaine）作为创伤性脑损伤（TBI）治疗方法的潜力。

伊波加因原产于西非，历史上被森林部落用于精神仪式，现在受到西方迷幻倡导者和精神健康研究人员的关注。一项由斯坦福大学资助的研究发现，伊波加因疗法改善了美国退伍军人中与 TBI 相关的症状和认知功能。

Soneira 正探索如何将伊波加因与心脏药物结合使用以减少与该植物相关的致命性心律失常的风险，并开发该化合物的人工合成版本。资金将支持 Soneira 早期阶段临床试验的研究工作。

布林对迷幻药物的兴趣是硅谷对这些物质及其个人和投资机会的潜在应用日益增长的热情的一部分。 Catalyst4 是使用布林 2021 年出售特斯拉股份的资金建立的。

通过谢尔盖·布林家庭基金会，布林已经投资了数百万用于神经退行性和心理疾病的研究，这是一种遗传突变导致他患帕金森氏症的风险增加。 Catalyst4 专注于神经疾病的突破性治疗方法和减轻气候变化的技术。

其他各方，包括 Helena Special Investments 和 LifeForce Capital，也讨论过投资 Soneira。该融资轮预计在夏季结束后关闭。

 **Google Co-Founder Sergey Brin's Non-Profit Funds Psychedelic Research**  

Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, is supporting the development of a hallucinogen derived from an African shrub as a mental health treatment. His non-profit investment vehicle, Catalyst4, has committed to cover around $15 million out of a total funding round of $25 million for psychedelic start-up Soneira. The biotech company is launching clinical trials investigating ibogaine's potential as a treatment for traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Ibogaine, native to West Africa and historically used in spiritual rituals by forest tribes, has gained attention among western psychedelic advocates and mental health researchers. A recent Stanford University-funded study found that ibogaine therapy improved symptoms and cognitive function in US military veterans with TBI.

Soneira is exploring how to combine ibogaine with heart medications to reduce the risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmia associated with the plant, as well as developing a synthetic version of the compound. The funding will support early stage clinical trials for Soneira's research efforts.

Brin's interest in psychedelics is part of Silicon Valley's growing enthusiasamo for these substances and their potential applications, both personally and as an investment opportunity. Catalyst4 was established with funds from Brin's 2021 sale of his Tesla stake.

Through the Sergey Brin Family Foundation, Brin has invested millions into research on neurodegenerative and psychological conditions due to a genetic mutation that puts him at heightened risk for Parkinson's disease. Catalyst4 focuses on breakthrough treatments for neurological disorders and technology to mitigate climate change.

Other parties, including Helena Special Investments and LifeForce Capital, have also discussed investing in Soneira. The funding round is set to close after summer.
