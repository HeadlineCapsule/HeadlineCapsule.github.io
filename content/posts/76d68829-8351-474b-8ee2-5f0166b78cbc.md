壳牌预计生物燃料厂停工将损失高达10亿美元

# Shell 鹿特丹生物燃料厂：10亿美元的挫折

最近，Shell 宣布其位于鹿特丹的停工生物燃料厂项目可能损失高达 10 亿美元。由于生物燃料市场状况严峻，该石油巨头本周暂停了该项目的工作。

鹿特丹工厂旨在将废物转化为飞机燃料和生物柴油，年产量约为 **82 万吨**。然而，自 2021 年获得批准以来，它一直面临技术困难而推迟。最初计划于 4 月生产，Shell 现在预计该厂将在“本十年后期”投入运营。

该公司正在审查该项目的经济学，因为面临着供过于求、来自中国的廉价进口以及欧洲需求增长低于预期的压力。去年 12 月，欧盟委员会还对中国生物柴油发起了反倾销调查，本月可能宣布对中国进口征收临时关税。

Shell 对十年末市场收紧保持乐观，并致力于在其首席执行官 Wael Sawan 的领导下实施更纪律严明、注重价值的战略。该公司计划在 8 月 1 日公布第二季度业绩时提供该项目的最终损耗数字。

生物燃料被认为比精炼石油燃料更可持续，因为它们通过生产它们的植物抵消二氧化碳排放。鹿特丹工厂预计每年将减少 **280 万吨二氧化碳排放**，相当于从道路上移除 100 万辆汽车。

其他公司，如 BP，也由于类似的市场挑战，最近在美国和德国削减了生物燃料产量计划。

 **Shell's Biofuel Plant in Rotterdam: A $1bn Setback**

In a recent development, Shell announced that it expects to take a hit of up to $1 billion on its stalled biofuel plant project located in Rotterdam. The oil major paused work on the project this week due to challenging market conditions for biofuels. 

The Rotterdam facility was intended to convert waste into jet fuel and biodiesel, with an annual production capacity of approximately **820,00cu tonnes**. However, it has faced delays since its approval in 2021 due to technical difficulties. Initially slated for April production, Shell now anticipates the plant becoming operational "in the latter part of the decade."

The company is currently reviewing the project's economics amidst pressure from oversupply, cheap imports from China, and lower than expected growth in demand within Europe. The European Commission has also launched an anti-dumping investigation into Chinese biodiesel last December, with provisional tariffs on Chinese imports likely to be announced this month.

Shell remains optimistic about the market tightening towards the end of the decade and is committed to more disciplined and value-focused strategies under its CEO Wael Sawan's leadership. The company plans to provide a final impairment figure for the project after running a review, which will be disclosed in its second-quarter results on August 1.

Biofuels are considered more sustainable than crude oil refined fuels as they offset carbon dioxide emissions through the plants used to produce them. The Rotterdam plant was expected to reduce emissions by **2.8 million tonnes of CO2 annually**, equivalent to removing 1 million cars from the road.

Other companies like BP have also recently scaled back biofuels production plans in the US and Germany due to similar market challenges.
