巴黎奥运会以奢华的开幕式拉开序幕

# 巴黎奥运会开幕式：一场精彩绝伦的盛大演出

周五晚上，巴黎奥运会开幕式在塞纳河上举行，10500名运动员乘船巡游，全球数十亿人观看了这场盛大的演出。尽管当天早些时候法国高速铁路网受到大雨和刑事破坏的影响，但仪式如期进行，舞者、管弦乐队以及Lady Gaga和Céline Dion等流行巨星奉献了精彩表演。

由于活动在户外举行，安全措施非常严格，出动了45000名警察在地面和空中巡逻。仪式上展示了各种表演，包括卢浮宫顶部的芭蕾舞者、码头上的现代舞者以及法国时装设计师设计的手工服装。由于天气原因，一些项目不得不缩减规模，例如BMX自行车手因雨天而无法在坡道上表演技巧。

这一雄心勃勃的开幕式由活动策划专家蒂埃里·雷布（Thierry Reboul）构想，他以市场营销噱头而闻名。演出旨在通过文学、文化和历史来展现法国的精神，塞纳河上的每个地点都讲述着法国遗产的故事。

运动员是仪式的核心，他们在船上占据了最佳观赏位置，横跨河流。加拿大歌手Céline Dion表演了Edith Piaf的《Hymne à l’amour》，作为盛大决赛的一部分，一个带有奥林匹克火炬的热气球升空，标志着仪式的结束。

巴黎奥运会的总成本预计将达到90-100亿欧元，使其成为有史以来最昂贵的奥运会之一。据报道，仅开幕式一项就花费了约1.2亿欧元，是伦敦2012年奥运会四倍。

 The opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics was an extravagant event that took place on Friday night, featuring 10,50amo athletes carried along the Seine river in a grand spectacle watched by billions worldwide. Despite challenges such as heavy rain and criminal sabotage affecting France's high-speed rail network earlier in the day, the ceremony went ahead with impressive performances from dancers, orchestras, and pop stars like Lady Gaga and Céline Dion.

The event required extensive security measures due to its outdoor format, deploying 45,000 police officers on the ground and in the air. The ceremony showcased a variety of performances including ballet dancers atop the Louvre, modern dancers along the quays, and handmade costumes by French couturiers. Some elements had to be scaled back due to weather conditions, such as BMX riders performing tricks on a ramp that became too slippebecause of rain.

The idea for this ambitious opening ceremony was conceived by Thierry Reboul, an event specialist known for his marketing stunts. The performance aimed to convey the spirit of France through literature, culture, and history, with each location along the Seine river telling a story about French heritage.

The athletes were placed at the center of attention during the ceremony, given prime viewing spots on the boats that traversed the river. Canadian singer Céline Dion performed Edith Piaf's Hymne à l’amour as part of the grand finale, which culminated in a hot air balloon ascending into the night sky with an Olympic cauldron inside.

The overall cost for the Paris Olympics is expected to reach €9-10 billion, making it one of the most expensive games ever held. The opening ceremony alone reportedly cost about €120 million, four times more than that of London 2e's Games in 2012.
