中国扣押台湾渔船台北说

**中国在金门岛附近没收台湾渔船**

最近发生的一起事件加剧了中国和台湾之间的紧张局势，中国海岸警卫队在台北控制的金门岛附近没收了一艘台湾渔船。这起事件发生在靠近中国海岸的地方，加剧了现有海上边界和主权声索的争端。

“台金满88号”在金门东北部海域捕鱼时被中国海岸警卫队拦截检查。台湾派出的海岸警卫舰被阻挡，导致追逐中止以避免冲突进一步升级。该船及其由五名外国工人组成的船员被带到附近的中国维头港。

这起事件发生在北京实施夏季禁渔令期间，台湾当局称该船违反禁令靠近中国海岸线活动。中国海岸警卫队声称，他们检查并拘留了使用禁用拖网和违反季节性捕捞禁令的台湾渔船。

这起事件进一步削弱了台北确保金门群岛海上安全的能力，自1949年中国内战以来，金门群岛一直处于台北的控制之下。它也引发了对台湾周边海域航运潜在干扰的担忧。中国声称台湾是中国领土的一部分，并威胁如果台北拒绝无限期服从其控制，将采取军事行动，不断在台湾边境附近举行军事演习，增加压力。

台湾担心中国军队可能通过削弱海上有效管辖权来破坏其主权。自今年2月两名中国渔民在金门附近海域非法捕鱼时被台湾海岸警卫队追逐时溺水身亡以来，中国增加了对台北宣布为禁区的群岛周边水域的巡逻。

台湾政府计划就没收的船只及其船员问题与中国进行磋商，敦促北京避免可能损害两岸关系的政治操纵。

 **China Confiscates Taiwanese Fishing Vessel Near Kinmen Island**

In a recent incident that has heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, Chinese coast guard forces have confiscated a fishing vessel from Taiwan near the Taipei-controlled island of Kinmen. The event occurred close to the Chinese coastline, escalating existing disputes over maritime boundaries and sovereignty claims.

The **Ta Chin Man 88** was stopped by the Chinese coast guard for inspection while fishing in waters north-east of Kinmen. Taiwanese coast guard ships dispatched to assist were blocked, leading to an abortion of pursuit to avoid further conflict escalation. The vessel and its crew, consisting of five foreign workers, were taken to the nearby Chinese port of Weitou.

The incident occurred during a ban on summer fishing imposed by Beijing, with Taiwanese authorities stating that the vessel had operated close to the Chinese coastline in violation of this restriction. The China Coast Guard claimed it inspected and detained the Taiwanese vessel for using prohibited trawling nets and violating seasonal fishing bans.

This event further undermines Taipei's ability to ensure maritime safety around Kinmen islands, which have been under its control since 1949 following the Chinese civil war. It also raises concerns about potential interference with shipping in waters surrounding Taiwan itself. China claims that Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened military action if Taipei refuses to submit to its control indefinitely, increasing pressure through continuous military exercises near Taiwan's borders.

Taiwan fears Chinese forces may undermine its sovereignty by eroding effective jurisdiction at sea. Since February, when two Chinese fishermen drowned during pursuit by Taiwan coast guard ships for illegal fishing off Kinmen, China has increased patrols in waters around the islands declared as being off-limits by Taipei.

Taiwan's government plans to seek consultations with China regarding the confiscated vessel and its crew, urging Beijing to refrain from political manipulation that could damage cross-strait relations.
