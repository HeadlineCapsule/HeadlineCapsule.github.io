民主党人绝望地看着将乔·拜登搁置一边的努力失败了

# 摘要：

文章讨论了民主党人日益绝望的情绪，因为他们在将总统乔·拜登从该党提名的职位上移除方面面临挑战，担心可能会输给唐纳德·特朗普。尽管最初希望由于负面民意调查和健康问题，拜登会自愿退出，但拜登表现出继续竞选的决心。这种情况正在导致民主党人的混乱、愤怒和存在恐惧，他们担心这会影响国会紧赛和民主本身。

文章强调了捐赠者、党派成员和竞选工作人员的各种反应：
- 捐赠者表达了对拜登担任职务的适合性和另一个特朗普总统任期的潜在后果的担忧。
- 党派内部人士描述他的行为像一个“疯王”，并担心这会影响国会紧赛。
- 在拜登竞选活动中，由于担心被指控掩盖拜登的衰退，人们讨论着留下来或离开。
- 一些民主党代表在拜登重申了他竞选总统的承诺后，表达了对他的忠诚。

文章最后提到即将举行的北约峰会上的新闻发布会，这将是拜登担任职务的另一次考验，可能会进一步影响民主党人对他表现的担忧。

This situation is causing confusion, anger, and existential fear among Democrats who worry about the impact on close races in Congress and democracy itself.

The article highlights various reactions from donors, party members, and campaign staff:
- Donors express concerns over Biden's fitness for office and potential consequences of another Trump presidency.
