送餐英雄股票因担忧欧盟罚款而下跌

# DHL 股价下跌，或面临 4 亿欧元欧盟罚款

在线食品配送公司 Delivery Hero 的股价大幅下跌超过 17%，此前该公司宣布可能面临来自欧洲联盟（EU）的反竞争罚款。潜在处罚金额估计超过 4 亿欧元。这一消息导致该股票在法兰克福首次交易期间中午前市时下跌了多达 5%。

欧盟对在线食品配送集团之间涉嫌反竞争行为的调查，例如分享国家市场和交换敏感商业信息，导致了 Delivery Hero 可能面临的罚款。该公司计划根据与欧洲委员会最近的接触以及 2022 年 7 月和 2023 年 11 月检查后的详细分析，"显著增加"其之前的 1.86 亿欧元的准备金。

欧盟一直在审查涉嫌违反竞争规则的公司，包括像 Delivery Hero 这样的在线配送集团。案件可能会对有罪方造成沉重的处罚，罚款金额高达全球营业额的 10%。仅在过去五年中，欧洲委员会就反竞争行为处以了近 40 亿欧元的罚款。

Delivery Hero 打算在此次调查期间与欧盟执行机构充分合作，就像在以前的检查中一样。伯恩斯坦（Bernstein）的分析师认为，尽管 Delivery Hero 的公告不具积极意义，但它对股价的短期影响应该有限，因为实施此类罚款可能需要时间。

该公司还报告了 2022 年和 2023 年超过 16 亿欧元的好将损失，这是由于大流行后宏观经济环境趋于严峻，导致在线食品配送服务增长放缓。为了集中资源，Delivery Hero 今年处置了一些资产，包括以 9.5 亿美元的价格出售其在台湾的 Foodpanda 品牌，并从优步手中收购了自己 3% 的股份。

 **DHL Shares Decline Amid Potential €400 Million EU Fine**

The online food delivery company, Delivery Hero, experienced a significant drop of over 17% in its shares after announcing the possibility of facing an anti-competition fine from the European Union (EU). The potential penalty is estimated to be more than €400 million. This news caused the stocks to fall by as much as 5% during mid-morning trading on their first session in Frankfurt since revealing this information.

The EU's investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices, such as sharing national markets and exchanging sensitive commercial information among online food delivery groups, has led to the potential fine for Delivery Hero. The company plans to "significantly increase" its previous provision of €186 million based on recent engagement with the European Commission and detailed analysis following inspections in July 2022 and November amo3rd, 2023.

The EU has been scrutinizing companies suspected of breaking competition rules, including online delivery groups like Delivery Hero. Cases can result in hefty penalties for the guilty parties, with fines reaching up to 10% of their global turnover. In the past five years alone, the European Commission imposed close to €4 billion in fines for anti-competitive practices.

Delivery Hero intends to fully cooperate with the EU's executive body during this investigation and has done so during previous inspections. Analysts from Bernstein believe that while Delivery Hero's announcement is not positive, its impact on the stock should be limited in the short term as such fines may take time to enact.

The company also reported goodwill impairment losses of more than €1.6 billion for 2022 and 2023 due to a tougher macroeconomic environment following the pandemic-fueled boost in online food delivery services. In an effort to focus its resources, Delivery Hero has disposed of some assets this year, including selling its Foodpanda brand in Taiwan for $950 million and acquiring a 3% stake in itself from Uber.
