法官驳回了保守派对纽约化石燃料退出计划的挑战

# 保守派支持的诉讼被纽约州法院驳回

一家州法院法官驳回了保守派支持的一项诉讼，该诉讼对纽约市决定退出化石燃料投资提出质疑。该案于 2022 年提起，由于由尤金·斯卡利亚 (Eugene Scalia) 领导的法律团队而受到密切关注，该团队认为提起诉讼的城市雇员因养老基金出售了超过 30 亿美元的公开交易化石燃料公司股票而遭受直接损失。然而，安德里亚·马斯利 (Andrea Masley) 法官裁定原告的索赔是“猜测性”的，并且不会根据纽约市财务长布拉德·兰德尔 (Brad Lander) 做出的投资决定遭受任何金钱损失。该裁决被视为负责任投资和该市未来的胜利，同时雇员律师正在审查潜在的下一步行动。

 **Summary of Article:**  
A conservative-backed lawsuit challenging New York City's decision to divest from fossil fuel investments has been dismissed by a state court judge. The case, filed in 2022 and closely watched due to its legal team led by Eugene Scalia, argued that the city employees who sued had suffered direct harm as a result of the pension funds selling over $3 billion worth of shares in publicly traded fossil fuel companies. However, Justice Andrea Masley ruled that plaintiffs' claims were "speculative" and they would not suffer any monetary losses based on the investment decisions made by New York City Comptroller Brad Lander. The decision has been hailed as a win for responsible investing and the future of the city, with lawyers for the employees reviewing potential next steps.
