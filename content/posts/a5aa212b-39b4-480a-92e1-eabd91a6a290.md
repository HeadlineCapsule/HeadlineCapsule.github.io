共和党人寻求调查微软在UAE的G42的15亿美元投资

**微软15亿美元投资阿联酋人工智能公司G42引发国家安全担忧**

共和党议员要求情报部门正式评估微软最近对阿联酋人工智能公司G42的15亿美元投资。写给国家安全顾问 Jake Sullivan 的信中强调，由于该交易可能与中国有关联并涉及敏感的美国技术转移，因此需要进行“特别审查”。

这项投资是G42从中国电信公司华为移除硬件的一部分，同时阿联酋同意从某些敏感地区移除华为设备。该交易因对美国技术转移的影响以及与中国的潜在联系而引起国会成员和国家安全官员的担忧。

议员们敦促国家情报委员会评估G42与中国的任何联系，并指出阿联酋统治者谢赫穆罕默德·本·扎耶德·阿勒纳哈扬最近在访问北京时与中国领导人习近平讨论了深化人工智能合作的问题。

G42过去曾公开表示与中国的距离，但最近的报道表明，其投资现在由总部位于阿布扎比的投资者和资产管理公司Lunate管理，后者由阿联酋国家安全顾问谢赫塔诺恩·本·扎耶德·阿勒纳哈扬监督。

微软表示，它正在与国家安全委员会和美国商务部密切合作，以确保“国家安全将继续是一项主要优先事项”。该行政部门与议员进行了定期对话，向他们简要介绍了数字基础设施投资的机会和风险。

 **Microsoft's $1.5bn Investment in UAE AI Company G42 Raises National Security Concerns**

Republican lawmakers have requested an official intelligence community assessment of Microsoft's recent $1.5 billion investment in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) artificial intelligence company, **G42**. The letter to national security adviser Jake Sullivan highlighted that this deal warrants "special scrutiny" due to its potential ties with China and the transfer of sensitive US-origin technology.

The investment was part of an arrangement involving G42 removing hardware from Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, while the UAE agreed to remove Huawei equipment from certain areas deemed sensitive. The deal has raised concerns among Capitol Hill members and national security officials due to its implications for US technology transfer and potential ties with China.

The lawmakers urged the National Intelligence Council to assess any connections between G42 and China, noting that UAE ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan had recently discussed deepening AI cooperation with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing.

G42 has publicly distanced itself from China in the past, but recent reports suggest that its investments are now being managed by Lunate, an Abu Dhabi-based investor and asset manager overseen by UAE national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed al-Nahyan.

Microsoft stated it is working closely with the National Security Council and US Commerce Department to ensure that "national security will continue to be a principal priority." The administration has been in regular dialogue with lawmakers, briefing them on opportunities and risks associated with digital infrastructure investments.
