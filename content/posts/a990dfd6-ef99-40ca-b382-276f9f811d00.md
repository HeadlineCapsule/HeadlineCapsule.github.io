英国宣布了数十年来最大的上市制度改革。

# 英国宣布数十年来最大规模的上市制度改革

金融行为监管局（FCA）宣布了对伦敦上市公司规则进行重大改变，这是30年来最实质性的改革。新法规旨在振兴英国的资本市场，并使其在竞争中与纽约等国际同行相抗衡。

**主要变化：**

1. **对风险投资公司和主权财富基金的超级投票权股票：** 公司现在可以发行“超级投票”股票，赋予创始人风险投资公司比其他投资者更强的投票权。这一变化旨在吸引希望通过双重类股份结构保持对公司控制权的高速增长初创企业。

2. **增强决策权力：** 公司高管在做出决定时无需股东投票，从而拥有更大的自主权，能够更灵活地应对市场状况。

3. **双重类股份结构：** 新规则允许像私募股权公司和风险资本家这样的机构投资者根据双重类股份结构持有超级投票权长达10年，除非主权财富基金是控制股东。

4. **放宽相关方交易批准：** 不需要股东批准相关方交易或某些大型交易，从而简化决策流程并减少公司的行政负担。

5. **简化上市类别：** FCA将高级和标准段合并到一个类别中，以进一步简化上市制度。现有公司将有过渡性安排来适应这些变化。

新规则作为前保守党政府发起的更广泛改革的一部分，预计工党政府会继续执行。这些措施旨在增加对英国资产的投资，并培养国内养老基金更大的风险承担文化。FCA还计划在今年夏天晚些时候审查招股说明书规则。

尽管一些投资者担心潜在风险，但支持者认为这些变化将使英国对寻求上市的创新公司更具吸引力，并有助于在全球竞争激烈的环境中振兴其资本市场。

 **UK Announces Largest Overhaul of Listings Regime in Decades**  

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced significant changes to the rules governing London-listed companies, marking the most substantial overhaul in three decades. The new regulations aim to revive the UK's capital markets and make them more competitive with international counterparts like New York.

**Key Changes:**  

1. **Supervoting Shares for Venture Capital Firms & Sovereign Wealth Funds:** Companies will now be allowed to issue 'supervoting' shares, granting founders and venture capital firms stronger voting rights than other investors. This change aims to attract high-growth startups that prefer dual-class share structures for maintaining control over their companies.
2. **Increased Decision-Making Power:** Company bosses will have more autonomy in making decatur without requiring shareholder votes, providing them with greater flexibility and agility to respond to market conditions.
3. **Dual-Class Share Structures:** The new rules permit institutional investors like private equity firms and venture capitalists to hold super voting rights under dual class share structures for up to 10 years, except in cases where sovereign wealth funds are controlling shareholders.
4. **Relaxed Related Party Transaction Approvals:** Shareholder approval will no longer be required for related party transactions or certain large deals, streamlining the decision-making process and reducing administrative burdens on companies.
5. **Simplified Listing Categories:** The FCA has merged premium and standard segments into a single category to simplify the listing regime further. Existing companies will have transitional arrangements for adapting to these changes.

The new rules come as part of broader reforms initiated by the previous Conservative government, which the Labour administration is expected to continue. These measures aim to increase investment in UK assets and foster a culture of greater risk-taking among domestic pension funds. The FCA also plans to review prospectus rules later this summer.

Despite concerns from some investors about potential risks, supporters argue that these changes will make the UK more attractive for innovative companies seeking listings and help revitalize its capital markets in a competitive global landscape.
