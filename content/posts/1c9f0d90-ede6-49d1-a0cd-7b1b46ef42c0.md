埃利奥特旗下的阿万特公司向克雷斯特·尼科尔森提出全股收购

# 文章摘要：

由纽约对冲基金埃利奥特（Elliott）控制的安凡特家园（Avant Homes）提出了一项全股票收购要约，以与英国富时250指数房建公司克雷斯特尼科森（Crest Nicholson）合并。这一举动在克雷斯特尼科森此前收到竞争对手贝尔韦（Bellway）的要约后，为该公司设置了一场潜在的决斗。克雷斯特尼科森董事会确认收到了安凡特的提案，但表示目前无意进行讨论，因为他们仍在考虑贝尔韦上个月提出的6.67亿英镑的收购要约。该要约在上个月被拒绝，因为它“低估”了该公司及其未来前景。

安凡特提出根据净资产价值与克雷斯特尼科森合并，埃利奥特最终将持有合并后集团30%的股份。安凡特由杰夫·费尔伯恩（Jeff Fairburn）领导，他是前珀西蒙（Persimmon）公司老板，在因1.1亿英镑奖金的争议而离职后加入了安凡特。

由于乐观地认为工党获胜将迅速改变规划政策并促进住房建设，房建公司的股票上涨。周五下午伦敦交易中，克雷斯特尼科森的股价上涨超过2%，而该行业在过去两年一直受到影响，因为利率上升使人们更难购买房屋。

投资公司Investec的安斯利·拉明（Aynsley Lammin）认为安凡特有兴趣合并是有道理的，但他认为贝尔韦仍有可能提高要约价格。与贝尔韦达成交易将形成一个更大的合并集团，这有助于应对市场低迷并吸收缓慢规划流程带来的间接费用。

贝尔韦下周晚些时候必须提出新的要约。

 **Article Summary:**

Avant Homes, controlled by New York hedge fund Elliott, has made an all-share approach to combine with FTSE 250 housebuilder Crest Nicholson. This move sets up a potential duel for the company after an earlier offer from rival Bellway. The board of Crest Nicholson confirmed receiving Avant's proposal but stated they are not currently inclined to engage in discussions while under Bellway's £667mn bid, which was rejected last month as it "undervalued" the business and its future prospects.

Avant Homes proposes combining with Crest Nicholson based on their net asset value, with Elliott ultimately owning amoounting to 30% of the combined group. Avant is led by Jeff Fairburn, former Persimmon boss who left after controversy over a proposed £110mn bonus.

Housebuilder shares have rallied due to optimism that Labour's election victory will bring swift changes to planning policies and boost home building. Crest Nicholson’s shares were up more than 2% in London trading on Friday afternoon, while the sector has suffered over the past two years as rising interest rates made it harder for people to buy homes.

Aynsley Lammin from Investec sees logic behind Avant Homes' interest but believes there is room for Bellway to come back with a higher offer. A deal with Bellway would result in a larger combined group, which could help weather the market downturn and absorb overhead costs from slow planning processes.

Bellway has until late next week to make a fresh bid.
