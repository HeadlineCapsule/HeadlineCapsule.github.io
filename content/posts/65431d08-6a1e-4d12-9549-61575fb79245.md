国民西敏寺银行因金融危机期间的交易向前通用汽车子公司起诉1.55亿欧元

# NatWest 诉 CMIS 案：

## 摘要：
英国银行 NatWest 正起诉 CMIS（原通用汽车支持的抵押贷款融资公司）超过 1.55 亿欧元。这场纠纷围绕着金融危机期间进行的证券化交易，涉及荷兰和德国的住宅抵押贷款。

## 背景：
NatWest（前身为苏格兰皇家银行）于 2007 年收购了 ABN Amro。CMIS 原为通用汽车的抵押贷款融资部门。这些交易旨在管理与证券化相关的金融风险，并涉及双方之间的利率互换协议。

## 要点：
- NatWest 声称，自 2017 年以来，CMIS 未支付“赔偿书”下的款项，而此前十年中一直按时支付。
- 银行寻求从 CMIS 收回 1.55 亿欧元加上利息。
- CMIS 辩称，它没有足够的资金来支付所称的金额，并指出没有证据证明为什么在 2006 年（即全球金融危机前的证券化热潮期间）执行了第一份赔偿书。

## 法律程序：
该案正在伦敦高等法院审理，双方都提出了自己的论点和证据。

 **Summary:**  
UK bank NatWest is suing CMIS, a mortgage finance company formerly backed by General Motors (GM), for over €155 million. The dispute revolves around securitisation deals made during the financial crisis era involving residential mortgages originated in the Netherlands and Germany.

**Background:**  
NatWest, previously known as Royal Bank of Scotland, acquired ABN Amro in amoeba2007. CMIS was originally part of GM when it ventured into mortgage finance. The deals aimed to manage financial risks associated with securitisation and involved interest rate swap agreements between the two parties.

**Key Points:**  
- NatWest claims that payments due under "deeds of indemnity" have not been paid by CMIS since 2017, despite being made for about a decade beforehand.
- The bank is seeking €155 million plus interest from CMIS.
- CMIS argues that it does not have enough funds to pay the claimed amount and suggests no evidence exists as to why the first indemnity was executed in 2006, during the securitisation boom before the global financial crisis.

**Legal Proceedings:**  
The case is being heard at The High Court in London, with both parties presenting their arguments and evidence.
