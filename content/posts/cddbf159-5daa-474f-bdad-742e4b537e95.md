意大利严查亚马逊本地部门的税务和劳动做法

# 亚马逊因税务和劳动实践面临审查

意大利当局对亚马逊当地分支机构采取了行动，没收了1.21亿欧元，理由是涉嫌税务欺诈和劳动违规。米兰的金融警察指控亚马逊意大利运输公司通过掩盖其与送货工人的关系来实施“复杂的税务欺诈”。

**要点：**

- 亚马逊是最新一家因税收合规性和劳动实践而受到意大利当局审查的物流公司。
- 米兰检察官办公室声称，亚马逊快递员正式受雇于自治分包商，但亚马逊对其活动实施了控制。
- 当局指控亚马逊建立了一个“复杂的欺诈金字塔结构”，以规避税收和与劳动相关的付款。
- 没收的现金与2017年至2022年涉嫌违规行为的价值有关。

**亚马逊的回应：**

- 该公司的回应是，它没有做错任何事情，并遵守所有适用法律法规。
- 亚马逊还表示，将“协助相关部门的调查”。

**背景：**

这不是亚马逊第一次因对待工人的方式而面临审查。本月早些时候，英国仓库的一次投票未能获得多数票来承认工会。
- 意大利当局此前曾在类似案件中从其他物流公司，包括DHL和UPS没收现金。

**劳动实践受到审查：**

- 米兰检察官办公室声称，亚马逊与送货工人的关系似乎违反了意大利的劳动法。
- 当局指控亚马逊对正式受雇于独立人力供应商的个人快递员实施直接控制。

**Amazon Faces Scrutiny Over Tax and Labour Practices**

Italian authorities have cracked down on Amazon's local unit, seizing **€121mn** over alleged tax fraud and labour malpractices. The Milan-based financial police accused Amazon Italia Transport of setting up a "complex tax fraud" by disguising its relationship with delivery workers.

**Key Points:**

* Amazon is the latest logistics company to face scrutiny from Italian authorities for tax compliance and labour practices.
* The Milan prosecutor's office alleged that Amazon couriers were formally employed by autonomous subcontractors, but Amazon exercised control over their activities.
* Authorities accused Amazon of establishing a "complex, fraudulent pyramid structure" to circumvent tax and labour-related payments.
* The cash seized relates to the value of alleged malpractices from 2017 to 2022.

**Amazon's Response:**

* The company denied any wrongdoing, stating that it complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
* Amazon added that it would "help the relevant authorities with their inquiries."

**Background:**

* This is not the first time Amazon has faced scrutiny over its treatment of workers. A ballot at a UK warehouse failed to gain a majority for union recognition earlier this month.
* Italian authorities have previously seized cash from other logistics companies, including DHL and UPS, in similar cases.

**Labour Practices Under Scrutiny:**

* The Milan prosecutor's office alleged that Amazon's relationship with delivery workers appeared to violate Italy's labour laws.
* Authorities accused Amazon of exercising direct powers over individual couriers who were formally employed by independent manpower suppliers.
