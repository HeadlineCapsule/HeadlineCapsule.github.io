Meta警告欧盟监管努力可能导致集团错过人工智能进步

# 欧盟在人工智能风险监管方面落后于先进技术的发展

Facebook的所有者Meta批评了欧洲联盟（EU）对人工智能（AI）的监管方法，称这将导致大陆无法访问前沿服务，从而造成“风险”。与此同时，欧盟继续努力遏制大科技公司的权力。

## 要点：

* **Meta的警告**：Meta的隐私副总裁兼政策副总统Rob Sherman警告说，欧盟的监管方法正在导致欧洲技术与世界其他地区之间出现“差距”。
* **暂停AI模型训练**：在欧盟隐私监督机构的请求下，Meta同意暂停使用该地区的数据训练其未来的AI模型。这为当地监管机构提供了时间来“了解生成式AI的问题”。
* **对可用性的影响**：Sherman表示，随着未来更先进的AI发布，欧洲的可用性可能会受到影响。
* **欧盟的回应**：欧盟表示，不会对公司个体的决定发表评论，但补充说，只要遵守法律，欧洲市场对企业来说就是一个有吸引力的市场。

## 词汇表：

* **生成式人工智能（Generative AI）**：一种能够生成新内容（如文本或图像）的人工智能类型。
* **多模态模型**：能够处理和理解多种类型数据（如文本、图像和音频）的人工智能模型。
* **《数字市场法》**：欧盟旨在监管数字市场并促进竞争的法律。

## 主题：

* **监管挑战**：文章强调了公司在导航欧盟复杂监管环境时面临的挑战。
* **全球竞争**：文章还涉及了科技巨头之间的全球竞争，例如苹果和Meta正在竞相商业化人工智能产品。

**EU's Regulatory Efforts on AI Risk Missing Out on Advances**

The European Union's (EU) approach to regulating artificial intelligence (AI) has been criticized by Meta, the owner of Facebook, for creating a "risk" that the continent will be cut off from accessing cutting-edge services. This comes as the EU continues its efforts to rein in the power of Big Tech.

**Key Points:**

* **Meta's Warning**: Rob Sherman, Meta's deputy privacy officer and vice-president of policy, warned that the EU's regulatory approach is creating a "gap" between the technologies available in Europe and the rest of the world.
* **Pause on AI Model Training**: Meta has agreed to pause the training of its future AI models on data from the region, following a request from the EU's privacy watchdog. This is to give local regulators time to "get their arms around the issue of generative AI".
* **Impact on Availability**: Sherman stated that with future and more advanced AI releases, it's likely that availability in Europe could be impacted.
* **EU's Response**: The EU said it does not comment on individual decisions of companies but added that it is an attractive market for businesses to provide services, provided they comply with the law.

**Vocabulary Terms:**

* **Generative AI**: A type of AI that can generate new content, such as text or images.
* **Multimodal Models**: AI models that can process and understand multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio.
* **Digital Markets Act**: The EU's law aimed at regulating the digital market and promoting competition.

**Themes:**

* **Regulatory Challenges**: The article highlights the challenges faced by companies in navigating the complex regulatory landscape of the EU.
* **Global Competition**: The article also touches on the global competition between tech giants, with companies like Apple and Meta racing to commercialize AI products.
