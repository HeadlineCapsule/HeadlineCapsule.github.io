特朗普的捐款激增4亿美元，与拜登的竞选资金竞争更加激烈

**摘要：**
唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）在第二季度的竞选筹款中激增了4亿美元，超过了4亿美元。这个金额几乎相当于他在整个2016年竞选期间的捐款总额，也是今年第一季度的三倍。这笔资金用于支付与特朗普涉及“封口费”的新约克刑事案件以及试图推翻2020年选举结果的指控相关的法律费用。

**要点：**
- 支持特朗普的团体在4月至6月之间筹集了超过4亿美元，这创造了第二财务季度的记录，几乎与2016年竞选期间的捐款额相匹配。
- 这些资金用于支付特朗普涉及“封口费”的新约克刑事案件以及试图推翻2020年选举结果的指控的法律费用。
- 在筹款方面，拜登一直领先，但特朗普最近的筹款增长使他有望超过他的民主党竞争对手。
- 著名捐赠者包括Tim Mellon（7500万美元）和Ike Perlmutter（1000万美元），此外还有来自硅谷和华尔街的更多亿万富翁向特朗普的竞选活动表示支持。
- 伊隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）最初对每月向特朗普捐款4500万美元的计划持怀疑态度，但后来他在社交媒体上发表声明确认了这一点。

**影响：**
支持特朗普团体的筹款成功表明这位前总统得到了强大的财务支持，这可能会影响2024年选举竞赛的动态。来自各行各业的知名捐赠者和亿万富翁的参与表明，特朗普对美国技术的愿景正在得到一些可能以前倾向于民主党候选人的有影响力人物的支持。

 **Summary:**  
Donald Trump's campaign fundraising surged by $4 gro-up in Q2, raising over $400 million. This amount is nearly equivalent to his total contributions during the entire 2016 campaign and three times more than the first quarter of this year. The significant increase was driven by small donors angered by Trump's New York criminal conviction and billionaires supporting him.

**Key Points:**  
- Pro-Trump groups raised over $400 million between April and June, a record second-quarter haul that nearly matches the 2016 campaign contributions.
- The funds were used to cover legal costs related to Trump's New York "hush money" case and charges of attempting to overturn the 2020 election results.
- Biden had been leading in fundraising, but Trump's recent surge puts him on track to outpace his Democratic rival.
- Notable donors include Tim Mellon ($75 million) and Ike Perlmutter ($10 million), with more billionaires from Silicon Valley and Wall Street showing support for the campaign.
- Elon Musk's potential $45 million monthly contribution to Trump was initially met with skepticism but later confirmed by his own statements on social media.

**Implications:**  
The massive fundraising success of pro-Trump groups indicates a strong financial backing for the former president, potentially impacting the dynamics of the 2024 election race. The involvement of high-profile donors and billionaires from various industries suggests that Trump's vision for technology in America is gaining traction among influential figures who may have previously leaned towards Democratic candidates.
