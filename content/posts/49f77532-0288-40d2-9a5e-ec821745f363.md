Wirecard 前首席财务官声称 2017 年后与业务的往来有限

# 简要新闻摘要：

Burkhard Ley，Wirecard 前首席财务官，作为清算人代表在伦敦高等法院的一起民事案件中出庭作证。他否认退休后仍属于 Wirecard 的“内圈子”，并声称退休后只涉及少量工作。该案围绕着 Greybull Capital 涉嫌误导性陈述而展开——即 Monarch Airlines 2016 年的资本重组是一项重大新投资，导致 Wirecard 在 2017 年航空公司倒闭时面临财务风险。

Ley 作证说，他与 Greybull 创始人 Marc Meyohas 会面，这次会议对 Monarch Airlines 的条款至关重要。他声称从波音公司筹集的资金被描述为来自“家庭投资池”。他还谈到了 Wirecard 向詹姆斯·亨利·奥沙利文（James Henry O'Sullivan）控制的企业提供的贷款，后者被指控是欺诈案中的关键同谋。

Ley 坚称自己无罪，与三家合作伙伴公司虚构收入的创建或接受无关，并且他自 2018 年后未参与提供 IT 服务。审判定于 7 月 18 日结束，Ley 将面临德国检察官提出的与欺诈、背信、会计和市场操纵有关的指控。

 **Summary:**
Burkhard Ley, former CFO of Wirecard, testified as a witness for the administrator in a civil case against Greybull Capital at London's high court. He denied being part of Wirecard'cu inner circle after his retirement and claimed to have had only minor involvement post-retirement. The case revolves around allegations that Greybull misrepresented Monarch Airlines' 2016 recapitalization as substantial new investment, leading to financial risk for Wirecard when the airline collapsed in 2017.

Ley testified about a meeting with Greybull founder Marc Meyohas that was crucial to the terms extended to Monarch Airlines and claimed that funds raised from Boeing were characterized as coming from a "family investment pool." He also addressed loans made by Wirecard to businesses controlled by James Henry O'Sullivan, an alleged key conspirator in the fraud.

Ley maintained his innocence regarding any involvement in the creation or acceptance of fictitious revenues attributed to three partner companies and stated that he was not involved in providing IT services after 2018. The trial is scheduled to conclude on July 18th, with Ley facing charges related to fraud, breach of trust, accounting, and market manipulation by German prosecutors.
