欧盟使用错误数据绘制森林砍伐地图，出口商发出警告

# 欧盟的毁林法规和出口国的担忧

欧洲联盟（EU）因其即将于12月31日生效的新毁林法规而受到巴西、澳大利亚和加拿大等出口国的批评。这些国家认为，欧盟用于识别毁林地区的数据绘制可能不正确或与他们对森林的定义不一致。

欧盟的法律旨在通过禁止与清退土地相关的进口来防止该集团内的消费导致其边界以外的毁林现象，包括牛皮、木材、可可、大豆、棕榈油、咖啡和橡胶等产品。这些商品的贸易价值在2022年约为1260亿欧元。

然而，几个国家对欧盟的数据绘制方法提出了担忧，认为这可能导致根据他们自己的森林定义免于毁林的地区被错误地禁止进口产品。澳大利亚大使馆和巴西大使都强调了他们各自的国家森林地图与欧盟毁林和森林退化观察站使用的地图之间的差异。

为了回应这些担忧，奥地利在六个成员国的支持下，呼吁布鲁塞尔重新考虑实施法规的时间框架，并解决与实施有关的重要问题。澳大利亚大使馆还要求推迟执行该规则，直到所有必要的安排得到理解并有效到位。

欧盟强调，其地图是帮助公司确保合规的工具，而不是强制性的。其他更细粒度或详细的信息也可以用作合规指南。尽管有了这些保证，出口国仍然对法规对他们生产者的潜在影响表示担忧，并呼吁推迟实施该法规，直到布鲁塞尔提供全面的指导。

**要点：**
- 欧盟的新毁林法将于12月31日生效，旨在防止该集团内的消费导致其边界以外的毁林现象。
- 巴西、澳大利亚和加拿大等出口国批评欧盟用于识别毁林地区的数据绘制方法，认为这可能导致根据他们自己的森林定义免于毁林的地区被错误地禁止进口产品。
- 奥地利在六个成员国的支持下，呼吁布鲁塞尔重新考虑实施法规的时间框架并解决与实施有关的问题。
- 欧盟强调其地图是帮助公司确保合规的工具，而不是强制性的；然而，出口国继续表达对潜在影响的担忧，并呼吁推迟实施该规则，直到布鲁塞尔提供全面的指导。

 **Summary:**  
EU's Deforestation Regulation and Concerns from Exporting Countries

The European Union (EU) is facing criticism from exporting countries such as Brazil, Australia, and Canada regarding its new deforestation regulations set to take effect on December 31. These nations argue that the EU's data mapping for identifying deforested areas may be incorrect or inconsistent with their own definitions of forests.

The EU law aims to prevent consumption within the bloc from causing deforestation beyond its borders by banning imports linked to cleared land, including products made from cattle, wood, cocoa, soy, palm oil, coffee, and rubber. The trade in these goods was worth about €126bn in 2022.

However, several countries have raised concerns over the EU's data mapping methods, arguing that they may lead to unjustified import bans on products from areas exempted under their own definitions of forests. The Australian embassy and Brazilian ambassador both highlighted discrepancies between their respective national forest maps and those used by the EU Observatory on deforestation and forest degradation.

In response to these concerns, Austria, backed by six other member states, called on Brussels to reconsider the timeframe for implementing the regulation and address serious implementation-related issues. The Australian embassy also requested a delay in enforcing the rules until all required arrangements are understood and effectively in place.

The EU has emphasized that its maps serve as tools to help companies ensure compliance, but they are not mandatory. Other more granular or detailed information can be used as guides for compliance. Despite these assurances, exporting countries continue to express concerns over the potential impact of the regulation on their producers and call for a delay in its implementation until comprehensive guidance is provided by Brussels.
