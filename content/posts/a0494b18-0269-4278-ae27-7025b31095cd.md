宜家在第五大道设立机构，其投资部门入股曼哈顿摩天大楼

# Ikea 进军曼哈顿

为了扩大在美国的存在，宜家与瑞典家具集团的投资部门 Ingka Investments 合作，在第五大道建立一个“客户见面点”。这标志着宜家进一步扩大美国市场的足迹，也符合全球零售商在全球主要城市收购优质房地产的趋势。

**投资细节：**

- Ingka Investments 将持有新建筑（570 五大道）三分之一的股份，以及优先股。Extell 开发公司保留剩余两份之二的所有权。
- 瑞典家具巨头计划完全拥有 8 万平方英尺的零售空间，并打算在建筑内创建一个宜家客户见面点。然而，此地的规划仍处于早期阶段。

**宜家的战略：**

- 该公司去年全球开设了 70 多个这样的“见面点”，这是其战略的一部分，旨在为居住在大型城市或大都会地区的客户改善可及性和便利性。这些见面点包括小型商店、弹出式商店和规划工作室，允许客户与顾问会面并下单送货上门。
- 宜家计划在美国开设八家大型商店和九个较小的规划工作室/订单点，预计在未来几年内，美国将成为其最大的市场，销售额超过德国。

**挑战：**

尽管有这些雄心勃勃的计划，但纽约市对宜家扩张的努力来说一直是一个挑战。由于租金成本高且人流量低于预期，该公司已关闭了曼哈顿上东区的规划工作室和皇后区的另一家商店。目前，宜家在纽约市仅运营布鲁克林的一家商店。

**全球趋势：**

宜家的投资符合大型公司在全球主要城市购买优质房地产的近期趋势。奢侈品品牌，如凯灵（Kering）和 LVMH，也已花费数十亿美元收购了欧洲和美国，包括纽约市第五大道的房地产。

**结论：**

宜家进军曼哈顿代表着一个战略性举措，旨在增加其在有利可图的美国市场的存在，同时应对高租金成本和像纽约市这样的大城市的人流量带来的挑战。

 **Ikea's Expansion into Manhattan**  

In a significant move to expand its presence in the United States, Ikea has partnered with Ingka Investments, the Swedish furniture group's investment arm, to establish a "customer meeting point" on Fifth Avenue. This marks another step towards increasing their footprint within the US market and follows similar trends of global retailers acquiring prime real estate in major cities worldwide.

**Investment Details:**  

- Ingka Investments will hold a one-third stake, along with preferred equity, in the new 1mn sq ft building at 570 Fifth Avenue. Extell Development Company retains ownership of the remaining two-thirds.
- The Swedish furniture giant plans to have full ownership of the 80,000 sq ft retail space and intends to create an Ikea customer meeting point within the building. However, planning for this location is still in its early stages.

**Ikea's Strategy:**  

- The company has been opening more than 70 of these "meeting points" globally last year as part of their strategy to improve accessibility and convenience for customers residing in large cities or metropolitan areas. These meeting points include small-format stores, pop-ups, and planning studios that allow customers to meet consultants and place orders for home delivery.
- Ikea aims to open eight large stores and nine smaller planning studios/order points across the US, with expectations of surpassing Germany as its largest market in terms of sales within the coming years.

**Challenges:**  

Despite these ambitious plans, New York City has proven challenging for Ikea's expansion efforts. The company closed a planning studio on Manhattan's Upper East Side and another store in Queens due to high rent costs and lower than expected foot traffic. Currently, Ikea operates only one store in Brooklyn within the city limits.

**Global Trend:**  

Ikea's investment aligns with a recent trend of large companies purchasing prime real estate locations across major cities worldwide. Luxury brands such as Kering and LVMH have also spent billions on acquiring significant properties in Europe and the US, including New York's Fifth Avenue.

**Conclusion:**  

Ikea's expansion into Manhattan represents a strategic move to increase its presence within the lucraturative US market while navigating challenges posed by high rent costs and foot traffic in major cities like New York City.
