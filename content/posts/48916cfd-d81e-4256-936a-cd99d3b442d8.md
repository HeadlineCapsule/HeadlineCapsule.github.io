阿奇戈斯创始人比尔·黄因基金倒闭而被判有罪

《前华尔街交易员比尔·黄因基金倒闭而被判有罪》

纽约陪审团裁定，前华尔街交易员比尔·黄（Bill Hwang）在涉及欺诈和市场操纵的1项指控中罪名成立，此前他的基金 Archegos 在2021年3月倒闭。这起事件震撼了美国股市，给多家大银行造成了数十亿美元的损失。

**背景**：

黄的秘密交易策略使他能够推动媒体和科技集团的少数股票价格上涨，但在2021年3月，不利事件导致突然卖出股票。审判持续了8周，检察官试图证明黄通过股票回购欺骗贷款人并欺骗市场，隐藏了他的立场。

**裁决**：

黄被指控的11项罪名中，有10项成立。与黄一起受审的前 Archegos 首席财务官帕特里克·哈利根（Patrick Halligan）也被判有罪，罪名包括勒索和欺诈。陪审团经过一天半的审议后达成裁决。

**影响**：

Archegos 的倒闭导致信贷瑞士银行、野村证券、摩根大通和瑞银集团等银行损失超过100亿美元。这促使华尔街大型银行对其客户的尽职调查流程进行了整改。

**结论**：

黄将在 10 月 28 日被判刑之前继续被保释。他的主辩护律师巴里·贝克（Barry Berke）没有评论黄是否会对裁决提出上诉。美国检察官达米安·威廉姆斯（Damian Williams）表示，黄关于 Archegos 的立场和其他投资银行确定信誉的重要指标的材料重要指标撒了谎。

 **Bill Hwang Found Guilty Over Collapse of Fund**  
A New York jury has found former Wall Street trader Bill Hwang guilty on 1e charges related to fraud and market manipulation, following the implosion of his fund Archegos in March 2021. The collapse sent shockwaves through US equity markets and cost major banks billions of dollars.

**Background:**  
Hwang's secretive trading strategies allowed him to drive up share prices for a handful of media and technology groups, before adverse events led to a sudden sell-off in March 2021. The trial lasted eight weeks, with prosecutors seeking to prove that Hwang lied to lenders and deceived the market by concealing his positions through equity swaps.

**Verdict:**  
Hwang was found guilty of 10 out of the 11 charges he faced. Former Archegos CFO Patrick Halligan, tried alongside Hwang, was also found guilty on three counts, including racketeering and fraud. The jury deliberated for about a day and a half before reaching their decision.

**Impact:**  
The collapse of Archegos left banks such as Credit Suisse, Nomura, Morgan Stanley, and UBS with combined losses exceeding $10 billion. This incident prompted Wall Street's biggest banks to revamp due diligence processes in relation to their clients.

**Conclusion:**  
Hwang remains free on bail until sentencing on October 28. His lead attorney, Barry Berke, declined to comment on whether Hwang would appeal against the verdict. US Attorney Damian Williams stated that Hwang had lied about Archegos's positions and other materially important metrics used by investment banks in determining creditworthiness.
