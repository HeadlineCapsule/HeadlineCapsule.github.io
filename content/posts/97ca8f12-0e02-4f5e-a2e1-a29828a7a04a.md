高盛在美联储压力测试争议中面临艰难挑战

高盛公司（Goldman Sachs）在试图反驳联邦储备委员会（Federal Reserve，美联储）今年进行的银行压力测试所给出的令人失望的成绩时面临着艰难的挑战。成功的前景被认为接近于零，监管专家建议，没有一家银行曾经推翻过美联储的评估上诉。

高盛公司面临着大约60亿美元的额外资本要求，这是美联储为覆盖经济衰退期间潜在损失而施加的。这可能会限制该银行的贷款和交易能力，并通过回购和股息支付影响利润和股东回报。

自2016年美联储引入当前版本的压力测试以来，银行的**上诉程序**一直存在。然而，到目前为止，银行提出的八次上诉都被拒绝了。银行政策研究所（Bank Policy Institute）的弗朗西斯科·科瓦（Francisco Covas）批评这一过程是“不充分的”和“大体无效的”。

高盛公司通过了年度财务健康测试，但比其大型竞争对手得到了更差的结果，预测在经济衰退期间损失超过400亿美元。这几乎是监管机构去年要求资本的一半。高盛公司首席执行官大卫·所罗门（David Solomon）对美联储的评分未能反映公司的演变和计划表示担忧，并希望与监管机构进行接触以获得更好的理解。

高盛公司尚未确认是否会正式上诉其压力测试结果，银行有两周的时间提出上诉。高盛上诉的理由仍然不清楚。有趣的是，在高盛自己进行的压力测试中，高盛的表现略优于美联储自己的压力测试。然而，美联储估计的高盛公司在经济衰退期间的费用高于该银行本身的预测。

**美联储**表示，它现在在分析银行在衰退期间的潜在损失时考虑了奖金削减。批评人士认为，审查过程偏向于银行，没有证据表明在上诉时对美联储自由裁量权的有意义检查。

 **Goldman Sachs** faces an uphill battle as it attempts to dispute its disappointing grade from this year's **bank stress tests** conducted by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The odds of success are considered close to zero, with regulatory experts suggesting that no bank has ever overturned a Fed assessment on appeal.

At stake for Goldman Sachs is approximately $6 billion in additional capital requirements imposed by the Fed to cover potential losses during an economic downturn. This could limit the bank's lending and trading capacity, as well as impact profits and shareholder rewards through repurchases and dividend payments.

The **appeals process** for banks has been in place since 2016 when the Fed introduced its current version of stress tests. However, all eight appeals made by banks have been rejected so far. Francisco Covas from the Bank Policy Institute criticizes this process as "inadequate" and "largely ineffective."

Goldman Sachs passed the annual financial fitness test but received a worse result than its large rivals, with predictions of losing over $40 billion during an economic downturn. This is nearly half the capital required by regulators last year. Goldman's CEO David Solomon has expressed concerns about the Fed's scoring not reflecting the company's evolution and plans to engage with regulators for better understanding.

Goldman Sachs has yet to confirm whether it will formally appeal its stress test outcome, which banks have two weeks to do so. The grounds on which Goldman could appeal remain unclear. Interestingly, Goldman fared slightly better in the Fed's own stress tests compared to their internally run ones. However, the Fed estimated higher expenses for Goldman Sachs during an economic downturn than what the bank predicted itself.

The **Fed** has stated that it now considers bonus cuts when analyzing banks' potential losses in a recession. Critics argue that the review process is biased against banks, with little evidence of meaningful checks on Fed discretion during appeals.
