人工智能初创公司Anthropic被控“恶意”数据抓取

# AI初创公司Anthropic被指控“令人发指”的数据抓取

Anthropic是一家由前OpenAI研究人员创立的AI初创公司，被指控为训练其系统而大举抓取网站数据。这种做法可能违反出版商的服务条款，并干扰其网站的运作。Anthropic以开发“负责任”的AI系统而闻名，并创造了先进的聊天机器人Claude，与OpenAI的ChatGPT展开竞争。

Freelancer.com和iFixit等网站报告了大量来自与Anthropic相关的网络爬虫的流量，其中Freelancer.com在短短4小时内经历了350万次访问。这些事件引发了对Anthropic是否遵守出版商请求并停止收集内容进行模型训练的担忧。

Freelancer首席执行官Matt Barrie表示，在尝试使用标准网络协议阻止其访问后，Anthropic的流量“大约是排名第二的AI爬虫的5倍”。iFixit也报告说，在单日内受到来自Anthropic机器人100万次打击，导致中断并触发了高流量警报。

Anthropic回应称，他们尊重出版商的请求，并在训练模型时努力做到不侵入或干扰。然而，从网站抓取公开可用数据的做法存在争议，可能违反服务条款协议。它还给站点托管方带来了额外的成本负担，因为增加了带宽使用量。

AI爬虫活动增加的原因被归因于领先的AI公司之间的竞争，例如Anthropic、OpenAI等，它们都在寻求通过挖掘网络未探索角落或创建合成训练数据来开发先进模型。虽然一些出版商已经与这些公司合作提供内容，但iFixit首席执行官Kyle Wiens强调，他的网站旨在自由分享信息，但希望参与有关使用其内容进行模型训练的任何讨论。

总之，Anthropic被各种网络出版商指控为AI模型训练目的而采用侵略性数据抓取做法。该公司声称尊重请求，并努力在训练先进AI系统时做到不干扰网站，同时承认负责任的发展需求。

 **AI start-up Anthropic accused of 'egregious' data scraping**

Anthropic, an AI startup founded by former OpenAI researchers, has been accused of aggressively scraping data from websites in order to train its systems. This practice may potentially breach publishers' terms of service and disrupt the functioning of their sites. Anthropic is known for developing "responsible" AI systems and creating advanced chatbots like Claude, a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Websites such as Freelancer.com and iFixit have reported significant traffic from Anthropic-linked web crawlers, with the former experiencing 3.5 million visits in just four hours. These incidents highlight concerns that Anthropic is swarming websites and ignoring requests to stop collecting their content for model training purposes.

Freelancer's CEO Matt Barrie stated that Anthropic was "probably about five times the volume of the number two" AI crawler, even after attempts were made to block its access using standard web protocols. iFixit also reported 1 million hits from Anthropic bots in a single day, causing disruptions and setting off alarms for high traffic.

Anthropn's response indicated that they respect publishers' requests and aim not to be intrusive or disruptive while training their models. However, the practice of scraping publicly available data from websites is contentious and can breach terms of service agreements. It also imposes additional costs on site hosts due to increased bandwidth usage.

The rise in AI crawling activities has been attributed to the competition among leading AI companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and others who are seeking advanced models by tapping into untapped corners of the web or creating synthetic training data. While some publishers have partnered with these companies for content provision, iFixit's CEO Kyle Wiens emphasized that his site aims to share information freely but wants to be part of any conversation regarding model training using their content.

In conclusion, Anthropic has been accused by various web publishers of aggressive data scraping practices for AI model training purposes. The company claims to respect requests and aim not to disrupt websites while acknowledging the need for responsible development in the field of advanced AI systems.
