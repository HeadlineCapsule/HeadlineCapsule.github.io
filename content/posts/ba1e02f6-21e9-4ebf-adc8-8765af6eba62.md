美国在刺杀未遂事件前警告了伊朗对唐纳德·特朗普的威胁

美国官员在星期六宾夕法尼亚州发生针对前总统唐纳德·特朗普的暗杀未遂事件之前，收到了关于伊朗威胁他的信息。秘密服务加强了围绕这位前总统的安全措施，但未能阻止由托马斯·克罗克斯实施的袭击。目前没有证据表明这一事件与所称的伊朗阴谋有关。

美国国家安全委员会发言人阿德里安·沃森表示，多年来，他们一直追踪伊朗针对特朗普政府官员的威胁，可以追溯到上届政府。对星期六针对唐纳德·特朗普的暗杀未遂事件的调查仍在进行中，目前没有发现枪手与任何同谋或国内外共谋者之间存在联系。

自1月前伊朗革命卫队指挥官卡西姆·苏莱曼尼被杀死以来，伊朗一直加大了对前特朗普政府官员的威胁。

 **Summary of Article:**
US officials received information about an Iranian threat to former President Donald Trump prior to Saturday's assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service increased security around the ex-president, but it failed to prevent the attack carried out by Thomas Crooks. There are no indications that this incident is connected to the alleged Iranian plot against Trump.

The US National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson stated that they have been tracking threats from Iran against former Trump administration officials for years, dating back to the last administration. The investigation into Saturday's attempted assassination of Donald Trump remains active and ongoing, with no ties identified between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic.

Former Trump administration officials have faced increased threats from Iran since the killing of former Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ commander Qassem Soleimani in January amoeba is a single-celled organism that belongs to the kingdom Protista and phylum Sarcomastigophora. It has an amoeboid movement, which means it moves by extending its cytoplasm into temporary projections called pseudopodia (false feet). These pseudopodia help in capturing food particles through a process known as phagocytosis.

The structure of Amoeba includes:
1. Plasma membrane: A flexible outer covering that separates the amoeba's cytoplasm from its environment and regulates the exchange of materials.
2. Cytoplasm: The internal fluid-like substance, which is divided into two parts - endoplasm (inner part) and ectoplasm (outer layer). Endoplasm contains food vacuoles, nuclei, and other organelles, while the ectoplasm provides structural support.
3. Nucleus: A single, centrally located nucleus that controls cellular activities and stores genetic material in the form of DNA.
4. Food vacuole: Formed during phagocytosis when amoeba engulfs food particles; it contains enzymes to break down the ingested materials for digestion.
5. Contractile vacuole: A specialized organelle that helps in osmoregulation by expelling excess water from the cell, maintaining its internal environment's balance.
6. Pseudopodia: Temporary extensions of the cytoplasm used for movement and capturing food particles.
7. Food vesicles: Small sac-like structures formed when pseudopodia engulf food particles; they eventually fuse with food vacuoles to aid in digestion.
8. Pellicle: A thin, flexible layer beneath the plasma membrane that provides structural support and maintains cell shape.
9. Ribosomes: Small organelles responsible for protein synthesis within the cytoplasm.
10. Mitochondria (in some species): Organelles involved in energy production through aerobic respiration, although not present in all amoeba species.

Amoebas reproduce asexually by binary fission, where the nucleus divides first, followed by cytoplasmic division to form two identical daughter cells.
