布林肯表示，第一批F-16戰機將在夏天飛上烏克蘭的天空。

**美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯表示，** 作为对乌克兰重大军事援助的一部分, 首批捐赠给乌克兰的 F-16 战斗机将于今年夏天抵达。这些来自丹麦和荷兰的飞机将前往乌克兰，挪威也宣布今年将开始向基辅交付六架 F-16。

这些战斗机被视为增强乌克兰防御俄罗斯攻击能力的重要因素，因为它们能够击落来袭导弹并有可能击落俄罗斯用于轰炸的飞机。美国、荷兰和丹麦致力于通过派遣现代第四代多用途 F-16 战斗机中队来增强乌克兰的空战能力。

然而，一些军事专家质疑在乌克兰部署老式 F-16 战斗机的有效性，因为它们与俄罗斯空军相比，雷达能力落后。尽管如此，乌克兰总统泽连斯基表示，交付这些战斗机是对抗俄罗斯侵略的明确信号，它会使公正和持久的和平更近一步。

北约成员国还承诺在未来一年内为乌克兰提供 400 亿欧元的支持，以在成员国内部动荡的情况下简化承诺。

 **Summary of Article:**  
The first F-16 fighter jets donated to Ukraine are set to arrive this summer as part of a significant military boost for the country, according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The planes from Denmark and the Netherlands will be en route to Ukraine, with Norway also announcing it would begin deliveries of six F16s to Kyiv within the year.

The jets are seen as crucial in bolstering Ukraine's defense against Russia's attacks due to their ability to shoot down incoming missiles and potentially Russian aircraft used in bombing raids. The US, Netherlands, and Denmark have committed to enhancing Ukraine's air capabilities with squadrons of modern fourth-generation F16 multi-role aircraft.

However, some military experts question the effectiveness of deploying older F16 models in Ukraine due to their outdated radar capabilities compared to Russia's air force. Despite this, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed that the delivery of these jets is a clear signal against Russian aggression and brings just and lasting peace closer.

NATO members are also pledging €40 billion in support for Ukraine over the next year to streamline commitments amid domestic turmoil within member states.
