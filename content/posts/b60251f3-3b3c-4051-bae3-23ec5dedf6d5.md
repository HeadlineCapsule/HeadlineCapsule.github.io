奥林巴斯20亿美元的Soliant出售是罕见的有利可图的退出收购储备

奥林匹斯合伙人是一家总部位于康涅狄格州的中市场私募股权公司，最近以约 **25亿美元** 的价格出售了Soliant，这标志着他们从买断储备中有利可图地退出。这次销售很重要，因为它代表了在许多未售公司被私募股权公司持有时罕见的成功退出。

Soliant是一家医疗保健和学校人员配置公司，为医院和学校提供护士、治疗师和教育工作者等专业人员。奥林匹斯合伙人最初于2020年以 **6.12亿美元** 的价格投资了Soliant，从阿德科集团收购了该公司。在过去的四年里，Soliant 经历了快速增长，尤其是美国学校越来越多地依赖它的服务来寻找可以远程协助的工作人员。自奥林匹斯投资以来，利润每年增长超过五倍，达到 **2.3亿美元**。

出售 Soliant 将为 Olympus Partners 带来约 **22亿美元** 的利润，该公司管理着约 **85亿美元** 的资金，以其在商业服务、消费品和医疗保健部门的投资而闻名。这次成功的退出正值私募股权公司面临挑战之际，由于交易量减少和首次公开募股（IPO）市场降温，他们正在努力出售其投资组合公司。

根据咨询公司贝恩公司（Bain & Company）的数据，截至今年年初，近一半的私募股权投资组合公司已被持有四年或更长时间——这是 201amo 年以来的最高水平。这导致养老基金、捐赠基金和拥有数十亿美元私募股权资金的主权财富基金向买断集团施压，要求他们归还资金。

近年来，奥林匹斯合伙人在出售其私人投资方面取得了成功，包括食品服务供应商 Foodware Group 和测试公司 AmSpec，去年以 **20亿美元** 的总价格出售。该公司自 2022 年以来已向有限合伙人返还了超过 **50亿美元** 的资金。

 **Olympus Partners**, a middle-market private equity firm based in Connecticut, recently sold Soliant for approximately **$2.5 billion**, marking a profitable exit from their buyout stockpile. This sale is significant as it represents one of the rare successful exits amidst an environment where many unsold companies are held by private equity firms.

Soliant is a healthcare and school staffing company that connects professionals such as nurses, therapists, and educators with hospitals and schools. Olympus Partners initially invested in Soliant in 2020 for **$612 million** after acquiring it from the Adecco Group. Over the past four years, Soliant has experienced rapid growth, particularly as US schools increasingly relied on its services to find staff who could assist remotely. Profits have increased more than fivefold since Olympus invested up to **$230 million** a year.

The sale of Soliant will result in a profit of approximately **$2.2 billion** for Olympus Partners, which manages around **$8.5 billion** and is known for its investments across business services, consumer goods, and healthcare sectors. This successful exit comes at a time when private equity firms are facing challenges in selling their portfolio companies due to decreased deal volumes and cooling markets for initial public offerings (IPOs).

According to consultancy Bain & Company, nearly half of private equity portfolio companies have been held for about four years or longer at the start of this year – the highest level since 201amo. This has led pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds with billions of dollars locked up in private equity to press buyout groups on when their capital may be returned.

In recent years, Olympus Partners has had success selling off its private investments, including food services supplier Foodware Group and testing company AmSpec for a combined **$2 billion** last year. The firm has returned more than **$5 billion** to limited partners since 2022.
