美国敦促陪审团认定阿奇戈斯的比尔·黄有罪：“这里发生的是欺诈”

**美国敦促陪审团**: 判处阿切戈斯（Archegos）的比尔·黄（Bill Hwang）欺诈和市场操纵罪。 

在为期八周的审判中，美国政府敦促曼哈顿陪审团在结案陈词时认定前交易员比尔·黄有罪，罪名是欺诈和市场操纵。 起诉人辩称，阿切戈斯资本管理公司（Archegos Capital Management）创始人黄通过欺骗性做法**人为推高了股票价格**，导致银行在2021年他的头寸崩溃时遭受数十亿美元损失。

美国助理检察官安德鲁·托马斯（Andrew Thomas）表示，这次崩溃不是偶然事件，并指控黄通过隐藏在维珍媒体（Viacom）、发现公司（Discovery）和GSX等公司的巨大持股来欺骗贷款人和投资者。 他声称黄的行为是为了个人利益而操纵市场的阴谋的一部分。

作为辩护方，律师巴里·伯克（Barry Berke）辩称，政府在阿切戈斯（Archegos）崩溃后倒推，未能证明黄如何从其股票的大额持股中受益。 伯克表示，没有证据表明黄在此期间提取了任何资金。

比尔·黄面临11项刑事指控，包括证券欺诈和勒索，以及前首席财务官帕特里克·哈林根（Patrick Halligan）的3项指控，包括电汇欺诈。 如果被定罪，两人都可能面临多年监禁。 陪审团将于周二开始审议。

在审判过程中，陪审团听取了阿切戈斯前风险主管斯科特·贝克（Scott Becker）和前头寸交易员威廉·托米塔（William Tomita）的证词，他们已因欺诈指控而认罪。 两人都作证说，黄指示他们谎报基金投资组合中集中持股的情况，使用隐瞒其身份的股票掉期。

起诉人声称，阿切戈斯建立在“欺骗文化”之上，高级管理人员共同误导对手方，而伯克辩称，黄对相关股票做出了长期承诺，并根据自己的信念投资。

 **US Urges Jury**: Convict Archegos' Bill Hwang for Fraud and Market Manipulation  

The US government urged a Manhattan jury to find former trader Bill Hwang guilty of fraud and market manipulation during the closing arguments in an eight-week trial. The prosecution argued that Hwang, founder of Archegos Capital Management, **artificially inflated stock prices** through deceptive practices, leading to billions of dollars in losses for banks when his positions collapsed in 2021.

Assistant US Attorney Andrew Thomas stated that the collapse was not a freak accident and accused Hwang of deceiving lenders and investors by hiding large stakes in companies like Viacom, Discovery, and GSX. He claimed that Hwang's actions were part of a scheme to manipulate the market for personal gain.

In defense, lawyer Barry Berke argued that the government had worked backwards after Archegos' implosion and failed to prove how Hwang benefited from his large positions in shares. Berke stated there was no evidence of Hwang cashing out any funds during this period.

Bill Hwang faces 11 criminal charges, including securities fraud and racketeering, alongside former chief financial officer Patrick Halligan, who is charged with three counts including wire fraud. If convicted, both could face years behind bars. The jury will begin deliberations on Tuesday.

During the trial, jurors heard testimony from Archegos' former head of risk Scott Becker and former head trader William Tomita, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Both testified that they were instructed by Hwang to lie about concentrated positions within the fund's portfolio using equity swaps that obscured their identity.

The prosecution claimed that Archegos was built on a "culture of deception," with senior staff working together to mislead counterparties, while Berke argued that Hwang had made long-term commitments to the stocks in question and invested based on his conviction.
