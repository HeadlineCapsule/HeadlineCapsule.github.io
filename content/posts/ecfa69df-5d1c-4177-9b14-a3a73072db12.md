微软和苹果放弃OpenAI董事会席位，以应对反垄断审查

**微软和苹果因反垄断审查退出 OpenAI 董事会**

在最近的反垄断审查中，微软放弃了 AI 初创公司 OpenAI 董事会的观察员角色。同样，苹果也不会担任类似职位，尽管此前有预期称，作为将 ChatGPT 整合到其设备中的部分内容，苹果会这样做。

微软做出这一决定之前，刚向 OpenAI 投资了 130 亿美元，并发表了一封信，指出其退出董事会角色的决定“立即生效”。该公司选择与包括微软、苹果、Thrive Capital 和 Khosla Ventures 在内的关键战略合作伙伴进行定期会议。

OpenAI 接触这些重要合作伙伴的新方法由其首席财务官 Sarah Friar 领导，她是上个月任命的。这一举措是在欧盟和美国的反垄断机构审查大科技公司对 OpenAI 等 AI 初创公司的投资时做出的。微软在 OpenAI 内部动荡后接受了一个无投票权的董事会职位，但现在认为由于新成立的董事会取得了显着进展，这不再是必要的。

OpenAI 仍然是微软最受重视的合作伙伴之一，双方的合作对计算能力和云存储的价值数十亿美元至关重要。对 OpenAI 的投资也使微软在生成式 AI 竞赛中领先了一步，促进了其 Azure 云计算平台最近几季度的销售加速。

OpenAI 坚持认为它是一家完全独立的公司，由 OpenAI 非营利组织管理，并继续淡化与微软的联系，因为反垄断担忧不断增长。欧盟委员会对潜在的反垄断调查表示了兴趣，而美国联邦贸易委员会则正在审查大科技公司对生成式 AI 初创公司的投资。

OpenAI 的八人董事会包括拉里·萨默斯 (Larry Summers) 和布雷特·泰勒 (Bret Taylor) 等知名人物，由山姆·奥尔特曼 (Sam Altman) 担任首席执行官。该公司对继续与微软的成功合作伙伴关系充满信心，尽管最近在董事会代表性方面发生了变化。

 **Microsoft and Apple Withdraw from OpenAI Board Amid Antitrust Scrutiny**

In a recent development amidst increasing antitrust scrutiny, Microsoft has relinquished its observer role on the board of AI start-up OpenAI. Similarly, Apple will not assume an equivalent position despite previous expectations to do so as part of integrating ChatGPT into their devices.

Microsoft's decision comes after investing $13 billion in OpenAI and follows a letter stating that its withdrawal from the board role would be "effective immediately." The company has opted for regular meetings with key strategic partners, including Microsoft itself, Apple, Thrive Capital, and Khosla Ventures.

OpenAI's new approach to engaging these crucial partners is led by Sarah Friar, its first chief financial officer since her appointment last month. This move comes as antitrust authorities in the EU and US examine Big Tech investments into AI start-ups like OpenAI. Microsoft accepted a non-voting role on the board following internal turmoil at OpenAI but has now deemed it unnecessary due to significant progress made by the newly formed board.

OpenAI remains one of Microsoft's most valued partners, with their collaboration being critical for both companies in terms of computing power and cloud storage worth billions of dollars. The investment in OpenAI has also propelled Microsoft ahead in the generative AI race, contributing to accelerated sales at its Azure cloud computing platform over recent quarters.

OpenAI maintains that it is an entirely independent company governed by the OpenAI Nonprofit and continues to play down ties with Microsoft as antitrust concerns grow. The European Commission has expressed interest in a potential antitrust investigation, while the Federal Trade Commission in the US scrutinizes investments made by Big Tech companies into generative AI start-ups.

OpenAI's eight-person board includes notable figures such as Larry Summers and Bret Taylor, with Sam Altman serving as its chief executive. The company remains optimistic about continuing their successful partnership with Microsoft despite the recent changes in board representation.
