英国计划将经营不善的水公司置于“特殊措施”之下

英国政府的“特殊措施”计划：英国政府已起草提案，将经营不善的水公司置于“特殊措施”之下，以清理英国水路。这可能导致下周出台新立法。环境大臣史蒂夫·里德（Steve Reed）提出了这些计划，其中包括禁止向严重污染水公司的高管支付奖金，并对屡教不改的违法者实施刑事处罚。

泰晤士水务公司（Thames Water）和东南水务公司（South East Water）：提案出台之际，英国最大水务公司泰晤士水务公司警告称，需要大幅提高账单才能吸引投资者，而东南水务公司也需要股东注入资金才能维持运营。两家公司都面临着财务挑战，并表达了如果没有额外资金就无法继续运营的担忧。

Ofwat的作用和立法：行业监管机构Ofwat正在准备宣布水公司未来五年可以提高多少费率，而“特殊措施”立法可能包括在部长们即将公布的一揽子法律中。里德召集了16家水公司的负责人讨论Ofwat关于费率的决定，并预计将引入对混合污水溢流的独立监控，这些溢流会将未经处理的污水排入水域。

潜在影响和争议：政府的计划可能与Ofwat提出的针对财务压力最大的水公司的“恢复制度”提案相冲突。此外，泰晤士水务公司因其首席执行官获得19.5万英镑的薪酬而陷入争议。

 **UK's 'Special Measures' Plan**: The UK government has drafted proposals to put failing water companies into "special measures" in order to clean up Britain's waterways, which may result in new legislation as early as next week. Environment Secretary Steve Reed is behind the plans that include banning bonuses for executives of heavily polluting water companies and imposing criminal charges on persistent lawbreakers.

**Thames Water & South East Water**: The proposals come at a time when Thames Water, Britain's largest water company, has warned it needs significant bill increases to attract investors, while South East Water also requires equity from shareholders to stay afloat. Both companies are facing financial challenges and have expressed concerns about their ability to continue as going concerns without additional funding.

**Ofwat's Role & Legislation**: The industry regulator Ofwat is preparing to announce how much water companies can raise bills over the next five years, with legislation for "special measures" potentially included in a new package of laws due to be unveiled by ministers. Reed has summoned the heads of all 16 water companies to discuss Ofwat's decision on bills and is expected to introduce independent monitoring of combined sewage overflows, which release untreated effluent into bodies of water.

**Potential Impact & Controversy**: The government's plans may conflict with a separate proposal by Ofwat for a new "recovery regime" targeting the most financially stressed water companies. Additionally, Thames Water has faced controversy over its chief executive receiving a £195,00 cuisine>
