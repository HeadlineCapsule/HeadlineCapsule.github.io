欧尔班·维克多抵达基辅 进行战时访问乌克兰

**维克多·奥班的首次战时访问乌克兰**

自2022年莫斯科对乌克兰发动全面入侵以来，匈牙利总理维克多·奥班首次在战时访问基辅。这次访问标志着欧盟和北约最突出的批评者对基辅持续军事援助的立场发生了重大转变，他也是本期间仅有的两个会见俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京的西方领导人之一。

当匈牙利担任欧盟理事会轮值主席国时，奥班抵达基辅。访问期间，他将与乌克兰总统沃洛德米尔·泽连斯基和其他高级官员会面。这次会议是在奥班和泽连斯基在布鲁塞尔举行的欧盟峰会上进行私人对话之后举行的，泽连斯基敦促所有欧盟领导人增加对乌克兰的军事支持。

尽管他反对向基辅提供资金援助和武器供应，但奥班政府上个月取消了正式阻止乌克兰与欧盟之间的入盟谈判的举措。布达佩斯通过声称基辅未能满足保障匈牙利乌克兰少数民族权利的要求来证明其强硬立场是合理的。

奥班将在与泽连斯基会面结束后发表简短讲话，但不会在他们的讨论之后举行新闻发布会。这次访问标志着奥班对乌克兰问题的立场可能发生转变，可能会影响未来欧盟立法，因为匈牙利承担了理事会轮值主席国的职责。

 **Viktor Orbán's First Wartime Trip to Ukraine**

Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has made his first wartime trip to Kyiv since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This visit marks a significant shift for the EU and Nato's most prominent critic of ongoing military aid to Kyiv, who is also one of only two western leaders to have met Russian President Vladimir Putin during this period.

Orbán arrived in Kyiv as Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the EU council. During his visit, he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other senior officials. The meeting comes after a private conversation between Orbán and Zelenskyy at an EU summit in Brussels, where Zelenskyy urged all EU leaders to increase their military support for Ukraine.

Despite his opposition to financial aid and weapons supplies to Kyiv, Orbán's government has lifted its block on formal EU accession talks between Ukraine and the bloc last month. Budapest justifies its hardline position by claiming that Kyiv is failing to meet demands in guaranteeing rights for Hungary’s Ukrainian minority population.

Orbán will deliver brief statements at the conclusion of his meeting with Zelenskyy, but no press conference will be held following their discussions. This visit signifies a potential shift in Orbán's stance on Ukraine and may impact future EU legislation as Hungary takes over the rotating presidency of the council.
