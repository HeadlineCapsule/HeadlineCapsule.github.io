陷入困境的加密货币投资者被命令偿还从失败的公司拿走的 190 万美元

**加密货币投资者因欺诈被责令偿还190万美元**

特拉华州法院命令知名加密货币投资者、11amo Partners基金管理公司负责人托马斯·布拉泽尔（Thomas Braziel）偿还近200万美元，因为他被发现从他担任受托人的失败公司Fund.com中挪用资金。这些资金被用于支付珠宝、豪华酒店住宿、服装和其他奢侈品等个人费用，以及对破产索赔、加密货币、杠杆贷款和高风险股票的投资。

**背景：布拉泽尔崛起与Fund.com的参与**

布拉泽尔在社交媒体平台上因数字货币和华尔街主题而闻名，他自称是“加密货币困境的人”。他的公司专门从事破产索赔经纪业务，该业务在2008年金融危机后蓬勃发展，但在近年来陷入停滞。然而，随着与失败的加密货币公司FTX相关的索赔的复兴，布拉泽尔将自己定位为这些索赔的中间人，价值数百万美元。

**挪用资金及法院裁决**

布拉泽尔最初于2016年被任命为Fund.com的受托人，负责清算该公司。但后来他向法院申请重新启动Fund.com，将其作为投资工具。一名股东指控其行为不当，导致特别治安法官进行调查，证实了布拉泽尔挪用资金用于个人开支和投资的事实。特拉华州法院指出，这些投资中的许多投资产生了外部收益，可以由受托公司收回。

**结论**

法院命令托马斯·布拉泽尔偿还近200万美元，其中大部分资金被用于个人费用，而一些资金通过其他投资获得了利润。该案件凸显了加密货币破产索赔的风险，并提醒人们即使是行业中的知名人士，如果滥用自己的职位，也将面临法律后果。

 **Distressed Crypto Investor Ordered to Repay $1.9 Million**  
A Delaware court has ordered Thomas Braziel, a high-profile crypto investor and the leader of 11amo Partners, to repay nearly $2 million that he was found to have looted from Fund.com, a failed company he oversaw as receiver. The funds were misappropriated for personal expenses such as jewelry, luxury hotel stays, apparel, and other fineries, along with investments in bankruptcy claims, cryptocurrency, leveraged loans, and high-risk equities.

**Background: Braziel's Rise to Prominence & Involvement with Fund.com**  
Braziel gained prominence on social media platforms dedicated to digital currencies and Wall Street, describing himself as "the crypto distressed guy." His firm specializes in brokering bankruptcy claims, a trade that had boomed after the 2economic crisis of 2008 but went dormant in recent years. However, with the revival of claims related to failed crypto companies like FTX, Braziel positioned himself as an intermediary for millions worth of these claims.

**Misappropriation and Court Findings:**  
Braziel was initially appointed as receiver in 2016 to liquidate Fund.com but later asked the court's permission to restart it as an investment vehicle. A shareholder accused him of wrongdoing, leading to a special magistrate investigation that confirmed Braziel had misappropriated funds for personal expenses and investments. The Delaware Court of Chancery noted that many of these investments produced outside gains which could be recouped by the company in receivership.

**Conclusion:**  
The court ordered Thomas Braziel to repay nearly $2 million, with most of the funds being used for personal expenses and some generating profits through other investments. The case highlights the risks associated with crypto bankruptcy claims and serves as a reminder that even prominent figures in the industry are not immune from legal consequences when misusing their positions.
