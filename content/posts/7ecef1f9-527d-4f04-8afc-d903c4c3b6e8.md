陷入困境的加密货币投资者被命令偿还从失败的公司拿走的 190 万美元

# 陷入困境的加密货币投资者被判偿还190万美元

特拉华州法院裁定，知名加密货币投资者、11amo Partners领导者托马斯·布拉齐尔（Thomas Braziel）必须偿还近200万美元，这些资金被其从已破产的公司Fund.com中挪用。法院确认了法院任命的调查员的结论，即布拉齐尔误用了公司资金进行个人支出和投资。

## 背景：布拉齐尔 nổi lên和与 Fund.com 的涉及

布拉齐尔在社交媒体平台上获得了关注，这些平台致力于数字货币和华尔街，他自称是“加密货币困境的人”。他的公司117 Partners专门从事破产索赔经纪业务——这种交易在FTX等加密货币公司倒闭后蓬勃发展。

## 法院裁定：资金误用和隐瞒企图

特拉华州法院确认了法院任命的调查员的结论，即布拉齐尔误用了公司资金进行个人支出和投资。该法院指出，这些投资中的许多投资产生了外部收益，可以由受托公司收回。此外，布拉齐尔还试图通过为税收目的更改银行记录来掩盖他的自交易行为。

## 加密破产索赔市场：FTX 的影响和 117 Partners 的参与

加密破产索赔市场经历了复兴，尤其是随着像 FTX 和其创始人山姆·班克曼-弗里德 (Sam Bankman-Fried) 这样的加密公司倒闭。布拉齐尔通过 117 Partners 定位自己来经纪数百万美金的 FTX 索赔，该网站声称已经纪了超过 3 亿美元的此类索赔。

## 结论：偿还命令和来自布拉齐尔的缺乏回应

特拉华州法院裁定托马斯·布拉齐尔必须偿还挪用的资金，但并没有立即收到他或他的律师对该裁决的回应。

**Court Findings: Misuse of Funds & Concealment Attempts**  
The Delaware Court of Chancery confirmed a court-appointed investigator's conclusion that Braziel misused company funds for personal expenses and investments.

Additionally, Braziel attempted to conceal his self-dealing actions through alterations in bank records for tax purposes.

**Crypto Bankruptcy Claims Market: FTX's Impact & 117 Partners' Involvement**  
The market for crypto bankruptcy claims has experienced a resurgence, particularly with the collapse of failed crypto companies like FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

**Conclusion: Repayment Order & Lack of Response from Braziel**
