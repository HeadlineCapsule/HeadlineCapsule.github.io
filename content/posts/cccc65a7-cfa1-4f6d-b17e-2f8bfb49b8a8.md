美国消费品公司正在失去定价优势

**美国消费品公司失去定价权**

文章讨论了美国消费品公司在不断变化的市场动态和竞争加剧的背景下，为维持定价能力所面临的挑战。重点包括：

- 美国的主要食品和包装商品集团正在经历提高价格的能力下降，这威胁着销售增长，同时也为应对通货膨胀压力的消费者提供了缓解。
- 过去几年实施价格上涨的公司现在正在转向提供更多折扣和促销活动来吸引客户。这包括增加优惠券的使用以及提高商店过道中的产品可见度。
- 根据NielsenIQ的数据，在截至6月底的12个月中，有28.6%的产品在促销期间销售，比三年前的25.1%有所增加。在欧洲这个许多美国消费品集团的重要市场，折扣也呈上升趋势。
- 通用磨坊和蒙德里兹等公司都承认了他们面临的挑战，尤其是由于低收入家庭的消费者行为变化。这两家公司都计划增加促销活动并相应调整定价策略。
- 到目前为止，这些变化对美国股指的影响是积极的，但人们仍然担心消费者对价格的敏感性增加可能影响更广泛的经济。
- 沃尔格林斯布茨联盟等零售商也感受到了消费者节俭习惯的影响，他们正在通过投资有针对性的促销活动来吸引客户并提高客户忠诚度。
- 耐克计划推出低于100美元的鞋子，承认了价值型消费者的压力。文章表明，由于消费者行为的变化，制造商和零售商提高价格的能力有所削弱。
- 然而，并不是所有公司都因为价格敏感性而出现销售下降。Foot Locker的客户愿意以全价购买产品，而宝洁公司认为，当涉及到像Tampax卫生棉和Pampers尿布等必需的家庭品牌时，消费者更看重可靠性和质量而不是节省成本。

总之，美国消费品公司正在努力适应不断变化的市场条件和竞争加剧，在维持定价能力方面面临挑战。公司通过提供更多促销活动和调整定价策略来应对，而一些零售商则因消费者行为的转变而出现下滑。

 **US Consumer Goods Companies Losing Pricing Power**

The article discusses the challenges faced by US consumer goods companies as they struggle to maintain their pricing power amidst changing market dynamics and increasing competition. The key points include:

- Major food and packaged goods groups in the US are experiencuing a decline in their ability to raise prices, which threatens sales growth while providing relief for consumers dealing with inflationary pressures.
- Companies that have been implementing price hikes over the past few years are now resorting to offering more discounts and promotions to attract customers. This includes increasing coupon usage and enhancing product visibility in store aisles.
- According to NielsenIQ data, 28.6% of products were sold with promotions during the 12 months ending late June, up from 25.1% three years ago. Discounting has also risen in Europe, an important market for many American consumer groups.
- General Mills and Mondelez are among companies that have acknowledged the challenges they face due to changing consumer behavior, particularly with lower-income households. Both companies plan to increase promotional activities and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.
- The impact of these changes on US equity indices has been positive so far, but concerns remain about how increased price sensitivity among consumers may affect the broader economy.
- Retailers like Walgreens Boots Alliance have also felt the effects of consumer thrift and are responding by investing in targeted promotions to drive traffic and customer loyalty.
- Nike plans to introduce footwear priced below $100, acknowledging the pressure on value consumers. The article suggests that manufacturers' and retailers' power to raise prices has been somewhat depleted as a result of consumer behavior.
- However, not all companies are experiencing declining sales due to price sensitivity. Foot Locker customers have shown willingness to pay full price for products, while Procter & Gamble believes that consumers prioritize reliability and quality over cost savings when it comes to essential household brands like Tampax tampons and Pampers nappies.

In summary, US consumer goods companies are facing challenges in maintaining their pricing power as they adapt to changing market conditions and increased competition. Companies are responding by offering more promotions and adjusting pricing strategies, while some retailers have experienced declines due to shifts in consumer behavior.
