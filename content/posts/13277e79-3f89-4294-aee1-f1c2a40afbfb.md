比尔·阿克曼告诉投资者他的“臭名昭著”将助推新基金

亿万富翁投资者 **比尔·阿克曼** 计划利用他在社交媒体上的大量关注度和类似于巴菲特的年度股东大会来接触潜在投资者，为他的新基金 **Pershing Square USA** 筹集资金。这家总部位于美国的投资基金预计将通过首次公开募股（IPO）筹集高达250亿美元，有可能成为有史以来规模最大的IPO之一。

在过去的一年里，阿克曼通过批评美国总统乔·拜登和支持前总统唐纳德·特朗普，以及在美国大学校园内反对反犹太主义运动，在社交媒体上获得了数十万粉丝。他计划利用自己的平台来讨论投资策略、投资组合中的资产以及为应对市场衰退而进行的重大投注。

该基金将作为一家管理公司结构，在纽约证券交易所上市，专注于具有竞争优势的低估值上市公司。它将采用封闭式结构，允许进行长期投资，并防止像传统共同基金那样赎回资产。

阿克曼在社交媒体上的关注度和广泛的媒体报道有望吸引投资者并为其股东创造流动性。该基金注册为《40法典》基金，在沟通方面受到的监管限制比Pershing Square Holdings少，后者因过去曾以折价交易而面临估值问题。

阿克曼还计划作为他认为有良好机会的IPO中的锚定股东行事，并可能通过一个单独的Pershing Square支持的车辆投资于Stripe或伊隆·马斯克的Starlink、X和SpaceX等私营公司。该基金将收取2%的管理费，而不像Pershing Square Holdings那样收取绩效费。

总之，比尔·阿克曼正在利用他在社交媒体上的影响力来推广他的新投资基金Pershing Square USA，并计划通过模仿沃伦·巴菲特的伯克希尔·哈撒韦股东大会来与潜在投资者联系。该基金旨在筹集高达250亿美元的IPO资金，并专注于具有竞争优势的低估值上市公司。

 **Billionaire Investor Bill Ackman** plans to use his significant social media presence and a Buffett-like annual meeting to connect with potential investors for his new fund, Pershing Square USA. The US-based investment fund is expected to raise up to $25 billion through an initial public offering (IPO), potentially making it one of the largest IPOs in history.

Ackman has gained hundreds of thousands of social media followers over the past year by criticizing President Joe Biden and endorsing former president Donald Trump, as well as campaigning against antisemitism on US university campuses. He plans to use his platform to discuss investment strategies, assets in the portfolio, and large bets made to protect against market downturns.

The fund will be structured as a management company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, focncing on undervalued publicly traded companies with competitive advantages. It will have a closed-end structure, allowing for longer-term investing and preventing redemption of assets like traditional mutual funds.

Ackman's social media following and heavy media coverage are expected to attract investor interest and create liquidity for shareholders. The fund is registered as a 40 Act fund with fewer regulatory restrictions on communications than Pershing Square Holdings, which has faced valuation concerns due to trading at a discount in the past.

Ackman also plans to act as an anchor shareholder in IPOs he deems good opportunities and may invest in privately held companies like Stripe or Elon Musk's Starlink, X, and SpaceX through a separate Pershing Square-backed vehicle. The fund will charge a 2% management fee without a performance fee, unlike the higher fees charged by Pershing Square Holdings.

In summary, Bill Ackman is leveraging his social media presence to promote his new investment fund, Pershing Square USA, and plans to connect with potential investors through an annual meeting modeled after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway gathering. The fund aims to raise up to $25 billion in its IPO and focuses on undervalued publicly traded companies with competitive advantages.
