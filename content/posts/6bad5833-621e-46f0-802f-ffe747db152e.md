AT&T“几乎所有”无线客户数据被黑客访问

**摘要：**
AT&T 遭遇了一次重大的网络安全事件，黑客访问了其近 1.1 亿无线客户的通话和短信信息。数据包括 2022 年 5 月到 10 月以及 2022 年 1 月 2 日的数据。AT&T 在与第三方网络安全公司 Mandiant 和 CrowdStrike 协商后，根据公共安全豁免规定推迟了向 SEC 的披露。

这次入侵发生在 4 月份的 11 天内，但该公司在存储数据的 Snowflake 平台上没有发现漏洞或配置错误。这是 AT&T 今年的第二次网络安全事件，第一次发生在 3 月。美国司法部确定推迟公开披露是合理的，以免影响其对国家安全和公共安全风险的调查。

AT&T 声称，它认为被盗记录不会被公开发布或包含个人信息。然而，可以使用在线工具将特定电话号码与姓名关联起来。该公司认为这次事件不会对其财务状况或运营结果产生重大影响。

 **Summary:**  
AT&T experienced a significant cyber security breach where hackers accessed the call and text message information of nearly all its wireless customers (110 million). The data included records from May to October 2022, as well as on January 2, 22. AT&T delayed disclosure under public safety exemption to SEC rules after consulting with third-party cyber security experts Mandiant and CrowdStrike.

The breach occurred over 11 days in April, but the company did not find evidence of vulnerabilities or misconfigurations on Snowflake's platform where the data was stored. This is AT&T's second cyber security incident this year, following one in March. The US Department of Justice determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted to avoid undermining their investigation into national security and public safety risks.

AT&T stated it did not believe the stolen records were made publicly available or contained personal information. However, there may be ways to find names associated with specific telephone numbers using online tools. The company does not think this incident will materially affect its financial condition or results of operations.
