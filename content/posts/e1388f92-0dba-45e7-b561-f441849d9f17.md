弗里德金家族收购埃弗顿足球俱乐部的交易破裂

# 埃弗顿足球俱乐部与弗里德金家族的交易破裂

拥有意大利足球俱乐部罗马队和美国汽车经销帝国的美国亿万富翁弗里德金家族，已经结束了收购埃弗顿足球俱乐部的独家接管谈判。这让英格兰最古老俱乐部之一的未来充满不确定性，因为他们现在正在探索其他所有权选择。

## 背景：

弗里德金集团上个月与目前拥有埃弗顿足球俱乐部的法哈德·莫希里进行讨论。然而，双方在周五宣布没有达成协议，接管将不会继续进行。双方的声明强调了他们在为俱乐部找到其他潜在买家方面相互利益。

## 财务挑战：

近年来，由于在球员上的大笔支出，埃弗顿足球俱乐部面临着财务困难，这会在疫情期间给足球财务带来严重影响时追赶上他们。该俱乐部在上个赛季因违反支出规则而被扣除英超联赛积分，并在过去三年中一直与降级作斗争。

## 外部因素的影响：

埃弗顿在新体育场的建设正在进行中，位于利物浦的布拉姆利-摩尔码头，这增加了俱乐部的财务负担。此外，由于俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，与寡头阿利舍尔·乌斯曼诺夫（Alisher Usmanov）相关的公司的赞助交易被取消了。

## 之前的出售尝试：

弗里德金集团不是埃弗顿足球俱乐部的第一个潜在买家。英国伊朗商人法哈德·莫希里（Farhad Moshiri）之前曾同意将俱乐部出售给总部位于迈阿密的投资公司777合伙人，但该交易由于777合伙人面临的财务审查和运营挑战而上个月破裂。

## 当前情况：

尽管与弗里德金集团的接管谈判破裂了，但他们仍将作为埃弗顿足球俱乐部的贷款人，并在新体育场的建设中发挥着重要作用。随着俱乐部继续在财务挑战和影响其稳定的外部因素中寻找潜在买家，它的未来仍然不确定。

 **Everton FC's Deal with Friedkin Family Collapses**  
The billionaire Friedkin family, owners of Italian football club Roma and a US car-dealing empire, has ended its exclusive takeover talks to acquire Everton Football Club. The collapse leaves the future of one of England’s oldest clubs uncertain as they now explore alternative options for ownership.  

**Background:**  
The Friedkin Group entered discussions with Farhad Moshiri, who currently owns Everton FC, last month. However, on Friday, both parties announced that no agreement had been reached and the takeover would not proceed. The statement from both sides emphasized their mutual interest in finding other potential buyers for the club.  

**Financial Challenges:**  
Everton FC has faced financial difficulties over recent years due to heavy spending on players, which came back to haunt them during the pandemic when football finances were severely impacted. The club was also docked Premier League points last season for breaching spending rules and has struggled with relegation battles in the past three years.  

**Impact of External Factors:**  
The ongoing construction of Everton's new stadium at Liverpool’s Bramley-Moore Dock, which has seen costs soar, adds to the club's financial burden. Additionally, sponsorship deals with companies linked to oligarch Alisher Usmanov were cancelled due to Russia'cuisine invasion of Ukraine.  

**Previous Attempted Sale:**  
The Friedkin Group is not the first potential buyer for Everton FC. British-Iranian businessman Farhad Moshiri had previously agreed to sell the club to Miami-based investment firm 777 Partners, but that deal fell through last month due to financial scrutiny and operational challenges faced by 777 Partners.  

**Current Situation:**  
Despite the collapse of the takeover talks with the Friedkin Group, they will remain as a lender to Everton FC and have played an important role in enabling the new stadium construction. The club's future remains uncertain as it continues its search for potential buyers amidst financial challenges and external factors impacting its stability.
