改革派佩泽希安赢得伊朗总统选举

**改革派候选人马苏德·佩泽什基安赢得伊朗总统选举，在第二轮选举中击败强硬派赛义德·贾利利，获得了1630万选票。这标志着改革派营地取得了重大胜利，人们希望放宽社会限制并重新与西方接触，以获得制裁救济。

**要点：**
- 佩泽什基安，前卫生部长，在伊朗总统选举第二轮选举中击败强硬派赛义德·贾利利获胜。
- 改革派阵营庆祝这一胜利，这是他们经过多年政治荒凉后取得的显著进步。
- 投票率从第一轮选举的40%提高到49.8%，创纪录新高。
- 佩泽什基安承诺将与西方谈判以获得制裁救济，并在互联网使用限制和希贾布强制执行等社会问题上采取更柔和的立场。
- 然而，人们认为他很可预测，不太可能挑战哈梅内伊的指导方针或在政治上制造麻烦。
- 强硬派仍然控制着议会、革命卫队等关键国家机构和其他影响国内外政策的有力实体。
- 由于伊朗继续发展核技术、向俄罗斯出售无人机、侵犯人权以及人们对佩泽什基安领导下意义重大的变化持怀疑态度，改善与西方关系面临挑战。

 **Summary:**
Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian wins Iran's presidential election, defeating hardliner Saeed Jalili in the runoff with 16.3 million votes. This marks a significant turnaround for the reformist camp and brings hope for easing social restrictions and re-engaging with the West to secure sanctions relief.

**Key Points:**
- Pezeshkian, former health minister, secures victory in Iran's presidential election runoff against hardliner Saeed Jalili.
- The reformist camp celebrates this win as a remarkable turnaround after years of political wilderness.
- Increased voter turnout at 49.8% compared to the first round's record low of 40%.
- Pezeshkian pledges to negotiate with the West for sanctions relief and take a softer stance on social issues, such as internet use restrictions and hijab enforcement.
- However, he is considered predictable and unlikely to challenge Khamenei's guidelines or rock the boat politically.
- Hardliners still control key state bodies like parliament, Revolutionary Guards, and other powerful entities that influence domestic and foreign policy.
- Improving relations with the West faces challenges due to Iran's continued nuclear advances, drone sales to Russia, human rights abuses, and skepticism about meaningful change under Pezeshkian's leadership.
