债券老将Jim Leaviss离开M&G

英国资产管理集团M＆G宣布，债券投资界知名人士、在公司工作近30年的**吉姆·利维斯**（Jim Leaviss）将离开公司从事学术研究。他目前担任M＆G固定收益首席投资官，管理着1390亿英镑的资产，并将在未来几个月内离职。

为了填补利维斯的职位空缺，M＆G从施罗德（Schroders）聘用了**安德鲁·乔尔顿**（Andrew Chorlton）。在约翰·帕图洛（John Pattullo）和费忠诚的伊恩·斯普德伯里（Ian Spreadbury）等其他顶级债券管理者离开该行业之后，这一举动发生了。M＆G将利维斯归功于推动了公司固定收益业务的发展，包括建立其信贷研究团队。

利维斯将于10月开始攻读艺术史硕士学位。乔尔顿将辞去他在施罗德固定收益部门和集团管理委员会中的职务。该公司表示将不会取代乔尔顿。

在职业生涯中，利维斯为债券市场做出了重大贡献，包括创立了M＆G的“债券警卫犬”博客，并在各种金融危机中提供了分析。回顾他在M＆G的时光，他指出，当他1997年加入公司时，只有四个人管理债券；如今，该团队已经发展到管理超过1300亿英镑债券，并设有伦敦、芝加哥、新加坡和巴黎等地的团队。

利维斯的离职标志着M＆G投资业务的重大转变，因为他们继续在固定收益投资领域发展壮大。

 **UK asset management group M&G** has announced that **Jim Leaviss**, a prominent bond investor with almost three decades of experience at the company, will be leaving to pursue academia. He currently oversees £139bn as chief investment officer of fixed income at M&G and is set to depart in the coming months.

To fill Leaviss's position, **M&G has hired Andrew Chorlton** from Schroders. This move comes after other top bond managers have left the industry, such as John Pattullo from Janus Henderson and Fidelity’s Ian Spreadbury. M&G credits Leaviss with spearheading the company's growth in fixed income, including developing its credit research team.

Leaviss will be starting a Masters in the History of Art in October. Chorlton is leaving his role as head of fixed income and his position on Schroders’ group management committee. The firm has stated that it will not replace Chorlton.

Throughout his career, Leaviss made significant contributions to the bond market, including founding M&G's "Bond Vigilantes" blog in 2amo and providing analysis on various financial crises. Reflecting on his time at M&G, he noted that when he joined in 1997 there were only four people managing bonds; today the team has grown to over £130bn of bonds under management with teams located across London, Chicago, Singapore, and Paris.

Leaviss's departure marks a significant change for M&G Investments as they continue their growth in fixed income investment.
