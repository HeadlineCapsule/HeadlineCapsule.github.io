范斯艰难的一周引发对特朗普竞选搭档的质疑

**摘要：**
在2024年总统选举中，唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）选择了JD Vance作为他的竞选伙伴，但Vance因发表有争议的言论和立场而受到批评和反弹。这些问题 khiến共和党人对Vance担任副总统的适合性表示怀疑。早期民调显示，Vance在连接选民方面遇到了困难，因为对他不利的观点正在上升，而有利的意见只显示出微弱的改善。

Vance的言论包括批评民主党人“**反家庭和反儿童**”，并提出没有孩子的美国人应该支付高于有家庭者的税率。他还建议选民应该代表他们的孩子投票，这一提议受到了政治光谱两端的批评。

民主党人利用了这些争议，将Vance描绘成一个“**古怪的人**”，并强调了他的“**脱节**”的想法。共和党的捐助者阶层也对Vance的选择表示怀疑，认为这是特朗普自大导致的结果，而不是可选性或政策因素。

尽管受到批评，但一些战略家认为仍然有时间在选民的眼中重新定义Vance，并解决他言论引起的问题。然而，其他人则认为，副总统的角色不会对选民的决定产生重大影响。

 **Summary:**
JD Vance, chosen as Donald Trump's running mate in the 2024 presidential election, has faced criticism and backlash due to his controversial comments and positions. These issues have raised doubts among Republicans about his suitability for the role of vice-president. Early polling suggests that Vance is struggling to connect with voters, as unfavorable opinions of him are on the rise while favorable ratings show only a slight improvement.

Vance's comments include criticizing Democrats for being "anti-family and anti-child" and proposing childless Americans pay higher tax rates than those with families. He also suggested that voters should be able to vote on behebalf of their children, which has been met with criticism from both sides of the political spectrum.

Democrats have capitalized on these controversies by depicting Vance as "a creep" and highlighting his "out-of-touch" ideas. The Republican donor class is also not convinced about Vance's selection, viewing it as a result of Trump's overconfidence rather than electability or policy considerations.

Despite the criticism, some strategists believe that there is still time to redefine Vance in voters' eyes and address the concerns raised by his comments. However, others argue that the vice-presidential role does not significantly impact voter decisions.
