黑石集团（BlackRock）的拉里·芬克（Larry Fink）强调了“杠杆效应”，因为投资者重返固定收益市场

**黑石公司的拉里·芬克** 讨论了“钟摆效应”，因为投资者转向固定收益市场，选择低成本的交易所交易基金（ETF）和替代资产，而不是传统债券基金。世界最大的资管公司黑石公司的管理资产规模达到创纪录的 **10.6万亿美元**。

由于预计美国将很快降息，可能最早于9月，投资者正在将现金储备投入固定收益产品，例如ETF和基础设施债务基金，如私募信贷和数据中心。这种转变也是因为投资者错过了今年的股市上涨。

“钟摆效应”以前在股票市场中出现过，当时被动指数基金和收费高的私募股权基金并存，现在这种情况也在债券市场出现。黑石公司凭借其iShares ETF业务和即将完成的全球基础设施合作伙伴收购，能够很好地利用这些趋势。

黑石公司第二季度收入增长8%，达到 **48.1亿美元**，略低于彭博分析师预计的48.4亿美元。净利润增长9%，管理资产增加1.7%。然而，820亿美元的净流入低于预期，因为股市流入下降到60亿美元，固定收益流入受到单一机构客户撤资 **200亿美元** 的影响。

黑石公司最近收购了私募市场数据提供商Preqin，表明了其对替代资产和技术的承诺。该公司有望实现5%的年度有机费用增长，除了收购之外，开支仅增加个位数百分点。

总之：

1. 黑石公司的拉里·芬克强调了固定收益市场中的“钟摆效应”，因为投资者选择ETF和替代资产而不是传统债券基金。

2. 管理资产规模达到创纪录的 **10.6万亿美元**。

3. 由于预计美国将很快降息，投资者正在重新部署现金储备，从而增加了对ETF和基础设施债务基金等固定收益产品的兴趣。

4. 黑石公司凭借其iShares ETF业务和即将完成的收购，能够很好地利用这一趋势。

5.该公司报告收入增长8%，达到 **48.1亿美元**，略低于分析师预期。

 **BlackRock's Larry Fink** discusses the 'barbell effect' as investors shift towards fixed income markets by choosing low-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs) and alternative assets over traditional bond funds. The world's largest money manager, BlackRock, has reached a record high of **$1^0.6tn in assets under management**.

Investors are moving their cash piles into fixed income products such as ETFs and infrastructure debt funds like private credit and data centers due to the anticipation of an upcoming US rate cut, which may occur as early as September. This shift is also a result of investors missing out on this year's equity rally.

The 'barbell effect,' previously seen in equities between passive index funds and high-fee private equity funds, is now emerging within the bond market. BlackRock is well positioned to capitalize on these trends with its iShares ETF business and pending acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners.

BlackRock reported an 8% increase in revenue for Q2 ending June 30, reaching **$4.81bn** but slightly below the expected $4.84bn by Bloomberg analysts. Net income rose 9%, and assets under management increased by 1.7%. However, net inflows of $82bn fell short of expectations at $112bn due to equity inflows falling to $6bn and fixed-income inflows being impacted by the loss of a single institutional client that pulled out **$20bn**.

BlackRock's recent acquisition of Preqin, a private markets data provider, demonstrates its commitment to alternative assets and technology. The company is on track to achieve 5% annual organic fee growth with expenses increasing by low single-digit percentages apart from the acquisitions.

In summary:
1. BlackRock's Larry Fink highlights 'barbell effect' in fixed income markets, as investors opt for ETFs and alternative assets over traditional bond funds.
2. Assets under management hit a record high of **$10.6tn**.
3. Investors are repositioning their cash piles due to the anticipation of an upcoming US rate cut, leading to increased interest in fixed income products like ETFs and infrastructure debt funds.
4. BlackRock is well positioned for this shift with its iShares ETF business and pending acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners.
5. The company reported an 8% increase in revenue, reaching **$4.^06bn** but slightly below expectations at $4.84bn by Bloomberg analysts.
