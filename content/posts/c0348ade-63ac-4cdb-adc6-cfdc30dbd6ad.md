鲁迪·朱利安尼的破产案件被美国法官驳回

# 美国法官驳回鲁迪·朱利安尼的破产案件

**摘要：**
美国法官驳回了鲁迪·朱利安尼（Rudy Giuliani）的破产申请；这位前纽约市市长再也不能利用破产程序来避免支付1.48亿美元的赔偿金，因为他被判诽谤了两名美国选举工作人员。法官肖恩·莱恩（Sean Lane）裁定，朱利安尼未能对其财务状况做到透明，也没有聘请会计师，因此弗里曼和莫斯可以追查他的资产。

**关键点：**
- 美国法官肖恩·莱恩驳回了鲁迪·朱利安尼的破产申请，因为他缺乏财务透明度。
- 前纽约市市长朱利安尼不能再利用破产程序来避免支付1.48亿美元的赔偿金，这笔钱是由于他被判诽谤了两名美国选举工作人员Ruby Freeman和Wandrea "Shaye" Moss。
- 朱利安尼未能聘请会计师并提供准确的财务信息，导致他无法申请第11章保护。
- 驳回破产申请后，弗里曼和莫斯可以追查朱利安尼的资产，包括他的房屋和来自电台节目、播客主持等各种创业项目的收入。
- 法官莱恩禁止朱利安尼在一年内再次申请破产。
- 朱利安尼没有反对驳回其案件，但声称他受到了过于广泛的发现请求，目的是要伤害他。
- 这位前市长还面临着刑事指控，已经对这两起案件均表示不认罪，同时正在上诉诽谤判决。

 **Summary:**  
US judge dismisses Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy case; former New York mayor can no longer use it to avoid $1amo judgment for defaming two US election workers. Judge Sean Lane found that Giuliani failed to be transparent about his finances and did not retain an accountant, leading to the clearance of a pathway for Freeman and Moss to pursue his assets.

**Key Points:**  
- Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy case dismissed by US judge Sean Lane due to lack of financial transparency.
- The former New York mayor can no longer use the bankruptcy proceedings to avoid a $148 million judgment for defaming two US election workers, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea "Shaye" Moss.
- Giuliani's failure to retain an accountant and provide accurate financial information led to his inability to file for Chapter 11 protection.
- The dismissal of the bankruptcy case allows Freeman and Moss to pursue Giuliani's assets, including homes and earnings from various ventures such as a radio show and podcast hosting.
- Judge Lane barred Giuliani from refiling for bankruptcy within a year.
- Giuliani did not oppose the dismissal of his case but claimed he had been subjected to overly broad discovery requests intended to harm him.
- The former mayor is also facing criminal charges and has pleaded not guilty in both cases, while appealing against the defamation judgment.
