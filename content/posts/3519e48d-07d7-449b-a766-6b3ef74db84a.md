日本钢铁公司聘请迈克·蓬佩奥进行游说，以推动150亿美元的美国钢铁收购

日本公司** Nippon Steel **聘请前美国国务卿迈克·蓬佩奥（Mike Pompeo）作为顾问，为其价值 149 亿美元的收购 US Steel 的有争议交易进行游说。这一交易面临着共和党和民主党人的反对，包括乔·拜登总统和唐纳德·特朗普。

蓬佩奥的经历包括担任国务卿、中央情报局（CIA）局长和美国国会议员。他的参与预计将帮助 Nippon Steel 克服乔·拜登总统和唐纳德·特朗普对该交易的公开反对，他们正在为即将到来的 11 月选举而争取宾夕法尼亚州的蓝领选民。

Nippon Steel 收购 US Steel 的目的是加强美国经济和国家安全。该公司已经获得了美国的监管批准，但仍然需要华盛顿通过国家安全审查的批准，并面临着强大的劳工工会的反对。

前特朗普竞选顾问斯蒂芬·摩尔（Stephen Moore）支持这项交易，称其为美国制造业的“经济胜利”，并将其描述为日本和美国之间“友善”的关系。人们担心拜登总统反对该交易可能会损害与美国最亲密盟友之一日本的关系，从而遏制中国崛起。

日本政府官员也参与游说以推动交易的进行。 Nippon Steel 仍然充满信心，并预测在总统选举之后将与工会进行“更冷静的讨论”。该公司表示，由于合并，不会裁员或关闭工厂，并且计划将美国总部从休斯顿迁至匹兹堡。

迈克·蓬佩奥的任命由彭博社首次报道。

 **Nippon Steel**, a Japanese company, has hired former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as an adviser in their lobbying efforts for the controversial $14.9 billion bid to acquire US Steel. This deal faces opposition from both Republicans and Democrats, including President Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

Pompeo's experience includes serving as Secretary of State, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and a U.S. congressman. His involvement is expected to help Nippon Steel overcome public statements against the deal from both President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, who are courting blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania for the upcoming November election.

Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel aims to bolster America's economic and national security. The company has received regulatory approval outside the U.S., but it still needs clearance from Washington through a national security review, facing objections from powerful labor unions.

Former Trump campaign adviser Stephen Moore supports the deal, calling it an "economic win" for the US manufacturing industry and describing it as a case of "friendshoring" between Japan and the U.S. There are concerns that Biden's opposition to the deal could damage relations with Japan, one of America's closest allies in containing China's rise.

Japanese government officials are also involved in lobbying for the deal to go through. Nippon Steel remains confident and predicts "calmer discussions" with unions after the presidential election. The company has stated that there will be no job cuts or plant closures due to the merger, and it plans to move its U.S. headquarters from Houston to Pittsburgh.

Mike Pompeo's appointment was first reported by Bloomberg.
