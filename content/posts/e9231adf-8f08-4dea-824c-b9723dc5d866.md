美联储降息和特朗普获胜推动黄金价格创纪录新高

**黄金价格因美联储降息预期和特朗普连任可能性创历史新高**

- 由于对美联储降息的预期以及唐纳德·特朗普总统连任的可能性，黄金价格周二飙升创纪录新高。
- 贵金属上涨 1.7%，达到每盎司 2465 美元，超过了今年 5 月的前峰值。这一增长是在上周美国通货膨胀数据低于预期之后发生的，这加剧了人们对美联储降低借贷成本的预期，并提振了像黄金这样的无收益资产。
- 周末针对特朗普的暗杀企图进一步增加了他连任的可能性。他的关税和减税等前任政策预计将增加美国预算赤字，加剧地缘政治紧张局势，并可能导致长期通货膨胀压力，从而增强黄金的安全避风港魅力。
- 标准渣打银行的苏基·库珀（Suki Cooper）将黄金价格的上涨归因于美国通胀数据走软重燃降息预期以及针对特朗普的袭击重新点燃了对安全避风港和通货膨胀对冲的需求。
- 这一历史新高标志着黄金 20 个月的强势上涨，在此期间，各国央行购买了创纪录数量的黄金以减少对美元储备的依赖。推动价格上涨的其他因素包括中东冲突和中国消费者对当地股市、房地产和货币市场令人失望的需求强劲。
- 投资者担心特朗普政府可能会导致美国通货膨胀和预算赤字上升，以及他希望降低利率可能对美联储独立性的威胁。
- 黄金价格还受到美联储将比预期更快地降低借贷成本的投注的推动。市场现在预计到 12 月将降息 2 次或 3 次，而上周仅预计降息 2 次。
- 特朗普获胜的前景可能会鼓励各国央行尽管价格高昂但仍继续购买黄金，因为美国和中国之间充满敌意的关系可能会促使他们继续寻找美元的替代品。纳蒂西斯（Natixis）的伯纳德·达哈（Bernard Dahdah）认为，2300 美元以上的价格可能成为黄金价格的新常态。

 **Gold Prices Reach Record High Amid Fed Rate Cut Speculations & Trump's Potential Second Term**

- Gold prices surged to a record high on Tuesday due to growing expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the possibility of Donald Trump securing a second term as president. 
- The precious metal gained 1.7% to reach $2,465 per troy ounce, surpassing its previous peak in May. This increase follows weaker than expected US inflation data last week, which heightened expectations of lower borrowing costs from the Federal Reserve and boosted non-yielding assets like gold.
- The assassination attempt on Trump over the weekend further fueled his chances for a second term in office. His previous policies involving tariffs and tax cuts are expected to increase the US budget deficit, escalate geopolitical tensions, and potentially lead to longer-term inflationary pressures that could enhance gold's safe-haven appeal.
- Suki Cooper from Standard Chartered attributes this rise in gold prices to a combination of softening US inflation data reinvigorating rate cut expectations and the recent attack on Trump reigniting interest in safe havens and inflation hedges. 
- The all-time high marks a 20-month rally for gold, with central banks purchasing record volumes to reduce their dependence on the US dollar in reserves. Additional factors contributing to this rise include conflict in the Middle East and strong demand from Chinese consumers amid disappointing local equities, property market, and currency markets.
- Investors are concerned about potential rises in US inflation and budget deficits under a Trump administration, as well as possible threats to the Federal Reserve's independence due to his desire for lower interest rates. 
- Gold prices have also been driven by bets that the Fed will cut borrowing costs faster than previously anticipated. Markets are now pricing in two or three rate cuts by December, compared with just two last week.
- The prospect of a Trump victory may encourage further gold purchases by central banks despite high prices, as an acrimonious relationship between the US and China could prompt them to continue seeking alternatives to the dollar. Bernard Dahdah from Natixis suggests that $2,30n and above might become the new normal for gold prices.
