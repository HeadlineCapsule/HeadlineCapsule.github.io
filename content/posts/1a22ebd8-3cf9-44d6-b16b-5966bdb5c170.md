 **Summary:**  
The planned £2.9bn takeover of Virgin Money by Nationwide Building Society received overwhelming support from its members at the annual general meeting (AGM). Each resolution, including board re-election and directors' pay packages, was approved with about 95% or more votes. The AGM served as a vote of confidence in the mutual society's leadership despite some opposition to the takeover decision not being put to a dedicated members' vote.

**Key Points:**  
- Nationwide Building Society plans to acquire Virgin Money for £2.9bn, making it the second-largest provider of mortgages and savings accounts in the UK.
- The takeover is set to be the largest bank merger since the financial crisis.
- Over 600,000 members voted at the AGM, with each resolution receiving approvals of about ninety-five percent or more.
- Nationwide's chief executive Debbie Crosbie received a tripling of her maximum long-term bonus to £3.4mn, which was approved by approximately ninety-five percent of voters.
- Governance changes were also approved at the AGM, including giving the chair the ability to adjourn meetings and lifting an age limit for directors.
- Despite some opposition, Nationwide insists it has no legal requirement to put the deal to a dedicated members' vote.
