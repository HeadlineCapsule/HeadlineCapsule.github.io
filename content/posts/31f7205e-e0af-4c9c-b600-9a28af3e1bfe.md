NBA冠军球队波士顿凯尔特人队将被业主团队出售

**波士顿凯尔特人队**即将由业主集团出售，预计将创纪录的价格上涨

波士顿凯尔特人队的业主宣布了出售球队的计划，这是在他们最近赢得 NBA 冠军以及职业篮球球队估值飙升之际做出的决定。 **波士顿篮球合作伙伴有限公司**董事会预计将在 2024 年或 2025 年初出售多数股权，并在 2025 年完成余下交易。
凯尔特人队于 2002 以 3.6 亿美元的价格被购买，此后福布斯将其估值为 47 亿美元。目前的业主集团包括 Wyc Grousbeck、Stephen Pagliuca（也是意大利足球队阿塔兰塔的拥有者）和 Robert Epstein。
出售凯尔特人队的决定是出于遗产和家庭规划考虑做出的，尽管并非所有业主都希望与球队分手。在 X 上发表的一份声明中，Pagliuca 表示希望继续参与竞标流程。
作为 NBA 历史上最成功的球队，凯尔特人队最近的冠军胜利进一步提高了他们的价值，并吸引了潜在买家。去年，菲尼克斯太阳队及其 WNBA 姐妹球队水星队的出售以 40 亿美元的纪录估值完成。
NBA 目前正在为其下一轮广播媒体权利进行谈判，预计费用将从目前的每年 27 亿美元左右翻一番。这种收入增长促进了职业篮球球队估值的飙升。
在相关新闻中，明尼苏达森林狼队的出售目前存在争议，并已提交仲裁，因为控制性业主 Glen Taylor 撤回了他出售该俱乐部给电子商务企业家 Marc Lore 和退役棒球运动员 Alex Rodriguez 的协议。最初，这笔交易的估值为 15 亿美元，包括 WNBA 的林克斯队。
NBA 委员 Adam Silver 表示，森林狼队出售的结果可能会导致联盟重新评估未来的交易。

 **Boston Celtics** set to be sold by ownership group, expected to fetch record price as valuations soar

The owners of the Boston Celtics have announced plans to sell the team, following their recent NBA championship win and amidst a surge in professional basketball franchise valuations. The **Boston Basketball Partners LLC** board expects to sell a majority interest by 2024 or early 2025, with the balance closing in 202
The Celtics were purchased for $360 million in 2002 and have since been valued at $4.7 billion by Forbes. The current ownership group includes Wyc Grousbeck, Stephen Pagliuca (who also owns Italian football team Atalanta), and Robert Epstein.
The decision to sell the Celtics was made for estate and family planning considerations, although not all of the owners wish to part ways with the team. In a statement posted on X, Pagliuca expressed his hope to remain involved in the bidding process.
As the most successful club in NBA history, the Celtics' recent championship win has further increased their value and attracted potential buyers. The sale of the Phoenix Suns and its WNBA sister franchise, the Mercury, set a record valuation of $4 billion last year.
The NBA is currently negotiating for its next round of broadcast media rights, with fees expected to roughly double from their current average of $2.7 billion per year. This increase in revenue has contributed to the skyrocketing valuations of professional basketball franchises.
In related news, the sale of the Minnesota Timberwolves is currently in dispute and headed for arbitration after controlling owner Glen Taylor withdrew his agreement to sell the club to ecommerce entrepreneur Marc Lore and retired baseball star Alex Rodriguez. The transaction was initially set to value the Wolves and WNBA's Lynx at $1.5 billion.
The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, has indicated that the outcome of the Timberwolves sale may lead to a reassessment of future transactions within the league.
