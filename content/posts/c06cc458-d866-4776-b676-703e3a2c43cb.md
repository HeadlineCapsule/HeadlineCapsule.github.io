美联储官员希望美国通货膨胀“更加稳定”

**摘要：**
美联储官员表示，在同意从23年来的高位下调利率之前，需要对美国通货膨胀降温更有“信心”。6月会议的纪要显示，一些成员认为价格压力正在减弱，由于消费者需求疲软，零售商提供价格折扣。然而，他们也表达了对失业率可能上升的担忧，如果利率长期保持过高水平。

联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）决定维持当前5.25-5.5%的利率水平，直到出现更多信息，从而更有信心地认为通货膨胀可持续地朝着美联储2%的目标前进。纪要出台前，人们对价格压力没有像预期那样迅速缓解感到担忧已有一段时间了，这使得官员们不愿意太快地降低借贷成本。

美联储此前在两年之前提高了利率，以应对2022年几十年来最高水平的通货膨胀。去年通货膨胀显著下降，但仍然高于目标水平。劳动统计局将于周五发布备受关注的就业市场报告，经济学家预测6月新增19万个工作岗位，远低于上月水平。

官员们在6月的会议上表示，他们预计今年只会降低一次借贷成本，低于他们之前的三次下调预测。通货膨胀和高借贷成本已成为美国总统乔·拜登的政治问题，民意调查显示，选民对生活成本和他对经济的处理感到不满。期货市场交易员现在预计9月有70%的机会降息——这是11月5日总统选举之前最后的政策决定。

 **Summary:**  
The Federal Reserve officials expressed a need for "greater confidence" in US inflation cooling before agreeing to cut interest rates from their 23-year high. The minutes from the June meeting revealed that some members believed price pressures were diminishing, with retailers offering price cuts due to weakening consumer demand. However, they also expressed concerns about potential rises in unemployment if rates remained too high for an extended period.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain the current interest rate level of 5.25-5.5% until additional information emerged that would provide greater confidence in inflation moving sustainably towards the Fed's 2% target. The minutes come after months of concern about price pressures not easing as quickly as hoped, making officials reluctant to cut borrowing costs too rapidly.

The Federal Reserve had previously increased rates two years ago to combat multi-decade high inflation levels in 2022. Inflation fell significantly last year and the central bank's preferred gauge dipped again to 2.n6% in May, but it still remains above its target. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release a closely watched job market report on Friday, with economists predicting that 190,000 jobs were added in June – a sharp slowdown from the previous month.

Officials indicated at the meeting in June that they expect to cut borrowing costs just once this year, down from their previous forecast of three cuts. Inflation and high borrowing costs have become political issues for President Joe Biden, with polls showing voters remain unhappy with the cost of living and his handling of the economy. Traders in futures markets are now pricing in a 70% chance of a rate cut in September – the final policy decision ahead of the presidential election on November 5th.

**Key Points:**  
- Federal Reserve officials seek greater confidence that US inflation is cooling before cutting interest rates from their 23-year high.
- Retailers are offering price cuts due to weakening consumer demand, but concerns remain about potential rises in unemployment if rates stay too high for too long.
- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) maintains the current interest rate level of 5.25-5.5% until additional information emerges that would provide greater confidence in inflation moving sustainably towards the Fed's 2% target.
