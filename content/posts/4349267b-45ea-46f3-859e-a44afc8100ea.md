淡马锡优先考虑美国交易，对中国保持谨慎态度

新加坡国营投资公司 Temasek 宣布了其投资策略的战略转变，优先考虑美国交易，同时对中国保持谨慎态度。该基金在截至3月的年度中，投资组合价值增长2%，达到3890亿新元（2880亿美元），由于美国和印度的投资增长，抵消了中国资本市场表现不佳的影响。

关键要点：
- Temasek计划专注于不依赖从美国和中国进口或向其出口的公司，因为中美紧张局势加剧。
- 基金对人工智能（AI）投资持谨慎态度，由于该行业的炒作，它更倾向于通过风险投资基金学习，然后再进行直接AI初创企业投资。
- Temasek在加密货币交易所FTX失败中损失了2.75亿美元，现在更加警惕人工智能和私募信贷市场等资本流入过多的领域。
- 美国仍然是Temasek在新加坡以外投资的最大目的地，由于与中国的地理政治紧张关系，印度、日本和东南亚也因其增长潜力而受到关注。
- Temasek多年来一直将分配从公共股票转向私营市场，截至3月，未上市资产在其投资组合中的占比达到52%。尽管担心随着利率上升和债务驱动型模式，回报可能降低，但Temasek相信，即使在剔除杠杆效应之后，私募股权投资仍然具有吸引力。

建议：
投资者应关注Temasek不断变化的战略，因为它正在应对地理政治紧张局势和行业炒作，以在美国、印度、日本、东南亚和私募股权市场识别潜在机会。

 **Summary:**  
Singapore's state-owned investor, *Temasek*, has announced a strategic shift in its investment approach by prioritizing US deals while exercising caution towards China. The fund reported a 2% increase in portfolio value to S$389bn ($288bn) for the year ending March, with growth from investments in the US and India being offset by underperformance in China's capital markets.

**Key Points:**  
- *Temasek* plans to focus on companies that do not rely heavily on importation from or exports to the US and China amidst rising Sino-US tensions.
- The fund is cautious about investing in artificial intelligence (AI) due to industry hype, preferring to learn through venture capital funds before making direct AI start-up investments.
- *Temasek* experienced a setback with its $275mn bet on the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX and is now more watchful of areas experiencing excessive capital inflows, such as AI and private credit markets.
- The US remains the largest destination for Temasek's investments outside Singapore, while India, Japan, and Southeast Asia are also gaining focus due to their growth potential amidst geopolitical tensions with China.
- *Temasek* has shifted its allocation from public equities to private markets over the years, increasing unlisted assets' share in its portfolio to 52% as of March. Despite concerns about lower returns due to rising interest rates and a debt-fueled model, Temasek believes that even after stripping off leverage effects, private equity investments still offer attractive returns.

**Recommendations:**  
Investors should monitor *Temasek'amo*s evolving strategy as it navigates geopolitical tensions and industry hype to identify potential opportunities in the US, India, Japan, Southeast Asia, and private equity markets.
