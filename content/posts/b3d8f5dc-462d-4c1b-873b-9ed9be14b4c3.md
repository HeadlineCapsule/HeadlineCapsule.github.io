投资者避开风险更高的垃圾债券，因为破产申请激增

**摘要：**  
由于破产申请数量激增以及对高利率的担忧，美国垃圾债券市场的投资者越来越避开风险更高的三C评级债券。风险债务的借贷成本与双B评级债券之间的差距拉大，反映了投资者对更安全选项的偏好。

**要点：** 
1. 由于担心弱势公司可能在高借贷成本和潜在衰退的背景下违约，投资者正将三C评级垃圾债券转售为双B评级垃圾债券。
2. 三C评级债券与双B评级债券之间的收益率差扩大了，投资者要求对低质量债务违约风险给予更高的补偿。
3. 高等级借款人比低质量公司更有能力应对高利率。
4. 美国联邦储备委员会的降息预期和美国总统乔·拜登的连任机会可能会影响垃圾债券市场，投资者预计如果利率长期保持高位，将面临更高的通货膨胀压力。
5. 2021年的破产申请数量已达到自2010年以来每年同期的最高水平，反映了美国公司面临的更广泛挑战。

 **Summary:**  
Investors in the US junk bond market are increasingly avoiding riskier triple-C rated bonds due to a surge in bankruptcy filings and concerns over high interest rates. The gap between borrowing costs for these risky debts and higher-quality double-B rated bonds has widened, indicating investors' preference for safer options.

**Key Points:**  
1. Investors are selling off triple-C junk bonds in favor of double-B junk bonds due to concerns over weaker companies potentially defaulting on their debt amid high borrowing costs and a possible recession.
2. The spread between triple-C rated and double-B rated bonds has increased, with investors demanding more compensation for the risk of default in lower-quality debts.
3. Higher-grade borrowers have more flexibility to handle high interest rates compared to lower-quality companies that are more vulnerable.
4. The US Federal Reserve's rate cut expectations and President Joe Biden's reelection chances may impact the junk bond market, with investors anticipating higher inflationary pressures if rates remain elevated for an extended period.
5. Bankruptcy filings in 2021 have reached their highest level at this stage of the year since 2010, indicating broader challenges faced by US companies.
