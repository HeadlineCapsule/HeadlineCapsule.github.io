投资者争相购买铂金基金，押注混合动力汽车

# 投资者对铂金基金的兴趣日益浓厚

由于混合动力车的复兴和传统内燃机汽车的需求持续强劲，投资者对铂金基金的兴趣日益浓厚。在第二季度，以实物铂金为支持 Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) 的持仓激增约 44.4 万盎司，为四年来最高水平。这几乎占年度需求的 6%，是自 2020 年以来的最大增长。

关键要点：
- 随着消费者对纯电动汽车 (EV) 越来越谨慎，混合动力车销量有所增加，而内燃机汽车的使用寿命预计将比以前更长。
- 投资者兴趣的驱动因素是 EV 增长的放缓和对内燃机的需求增加，氢可能成为铂金未来的一个催化剂。
- 铂金价格在一个月内上涨了 20%，但此后回落了一些收益，截至本文发布时，每盎司交易价为 1,014 美元。
- 投资者正在将黄金拉升的利润重新分配到白银和铂金等其他贵金属中。
- 今年，钯金 ETF 的流入也很强劲，投资额相当于 20 万盎司。
- 全球汽车制造商正在扩大其混合动力车阵容，因为电动汽车的销售增长放缓，这与成本和基础设施问题有关。与电动汽车相比，混合动力车为制造商提供了更高的利润率。
- 今年欧洲混合动力车销量增长了 21%，美国销量增长了 35%。
- 铂金在混合动力车的催化转换器中比传统发动机和数据存储设备的使用量更大。

影响：
由于混合动力车复兴，以及对内燃机汽车持续的需求，铂金需求增加，导致以实物铂金为支持 ETF 投资的激增。预计这一趋势将继续下去，因为汽车制造商扩大其混合动力产品线，消费者对纯电动汽车保持谨慎态度。此外，对锂、钴和镍等用于电池金属的需求放缓也支持了对铂金投资的兴趣。

 **Summary:**  
Investors are showing increased interest in platinum funds due to a resurgence of hybrid vehicles and sustained demand for traditional combustion engine cars. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by physical platinum experienced the highest inflows in four years during Q2, with holdings surging by approximately 444,000 ounces. This accounts for nearly 6% of annual demand and is the largest increase since 2e20.

**Key Points:**  
- Hybrid vehicle sales have increased as consumers grow wary of fully electric vehicles (EVs), while combustion engine cars are predicted to remain in use longer than previously thought.
- Investor interest is driven by slower EV growth and higher demand for combustion engines, with hydrogen being a potential future catalyst for platinum.
- Platinum prices rose 20% over a month but have since retraced some gains to trade at $1,014 per ounce as of the article's publication date.
- Investors are reallocating profits from gold rallies into other precious metals like silver and platinum.
- ETF inflows for palladium have also been strong this year, with investments equating to 200,000 ounces.
- Global carmakers are expanding their hybrid vehicle lineups as sales growth of EVs slow due to cost and infrastructure concerns. Hybrids offer higher profit margins for manufacturers compared to EVs.
- Sales of hybrid vehicles in Europe have climbed 21% this year, while US sales rose by eby 35%.
- Platinum is used more heavily in catalytic converters for hybrids than traditional engines and data storage devices.

**Implications:**  
The increased demand for platinum due to the resurgence of hybrid vehicles, coupled with sustained interest in combustion engine cars, has led to a surge in ETF investments backed by physical platinum. This trend is expected to continue as carmakers expand their hybrid offerings and consumers remain cautious about fully electric vehicles. Additionally, the slowdown in demand for metals used in batteries like lithium, cobalt, and nickel further supports investment interest in platinum.
