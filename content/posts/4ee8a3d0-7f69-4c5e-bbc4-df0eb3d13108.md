美国大型银行警告低收入消费者出现压力

**摘要：**
美国大银行，如摩根大通、花旗集团、富国银行和纽约梅隆银行在其二季度业绩报告中显示了低收入消费者出现财务困境的迹象。这发生在总统大选前几个月，根据密歇根大学的调查，消费者信心降至8个月以来的最低水平。

**要点：**
1. 低储蓄和高物价影响了低收入消费者的财务健康。
2. 随着账户余额比新冠疫情前减少，消费者支出放缓。
3. 通货膨胀对没有资产或未投资于股市的群体尤其痛苦。
4. 美国低收入人群正在消耗他们的疫情储备金，同时面临着更高的价格。
5. 美国银行的贷款收入下降，因为个人和企业客户的贷款需求仍然疲软。
6. 在金融街经历了财务压力期间，投资银行一直是该行业的一抹亮色。

**财务影响：**
- 摩根大通的利润达到创纪录的二季度高点，净利润同比增长25%；然而，不包括一次性影响，净利润仅增长不到1%。
- 花旗集团报告季度利润增长10%至32亿美元，得益于投资银行和成本削减措施。
- 富国银行第二季度利润略降0.6%至49亿美元。
- 纽约梅隆银行由于在资金管理和托管方面的专业知识，收入和净利润超出分析师预期，这些领域对低收入消费者影响较小。

 **Summary:**  
Big US banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of New York Mellon have reported signs of financial stress among lower-income consumers in their second quarter results. This comes just months before the presidential election, with consumer sentiment at an eight-month low according to a University of Michigan survey.

**Key Points:**  
1. Lower savings and higher prices are impacting lower-income customers' financial health.
2. Consumer spending is slowing down, as evidenced by decreased account balances compared to pre-Covid levels.
3. Inflation has been particularly painful for those without assets or investments in the stock market.
4. Lower-income Americans are depleting their pandemic reserves and facing higher prices.
5. US banks have reported lower income from lending, as loan demand remains tepid among individual and corporate clients.
6. Investment banking has been a bright spot for the industry during this period of financial stress on Main Street.

**Financial Impact:**  
- JPMorgan Chase's profits reached a record high in Q2, with net income up 25% from last year; however, excluding one-off effects, net income was only up by less than 1%.
- Citigroup reported a 10% increase in quarterly profits to $3.2 billion, driven by investment banking and cost cutting measures.
- Wells Fargo experienced a slight drop of 0.6% in profits to $4.9 billion during Q2.
- Bank of New York Mellon beat analyst expectations for revenue and net income due to its specializations in money management and custody, which are less exposed to lower-income consumers.
