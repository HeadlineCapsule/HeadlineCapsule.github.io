欧洲央行准备关闭由安德鲁王子长期顾问拥有的贷款机构

# 欧洲中央银行将撤销Banque Havilland的牌照

欧洲中央银行（ECB）正在准备撤销卢森堡贷款机构Banque Havilland的经营许可证，该机构由David Rowland和他的家族拥有。由于在他们拥有期间涉嫌合规和反洗钱失败而受到多项监管调查。

# Banque Havilland争议历史

这家银行以前是冰岛Kaupthing银行的一部分，在2009年被Rowland家族购买并更名为他们的格恩西岛庄园的名字，一直陷入争议之中。它因受沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国客户的委托，试图操纵卡塔尔货币而受到金融行为监管局的罚款。

# ECB的决定草案尚未最终确定

ECB的决定草案有待其董事会批准，这通常被视为一个形式性程序。一旦获得批准，Banque Havilland将失去在欧洲运营的能力，归因于金融业监管委员会（CSSF）的管辖范围。

# 位于ECB监管管辖区外的分支机构的前景不明朗

Banque Havilland在迪拜、瑞士、列支敦士登和摩纳哥的分支机构的前景仍不确定，因为它们可能继续根据自己的当地牌照运营。瑞士监管机构Finma正在监控苏黎世分行和其他在瑞士获得牌照的银行是否遵守法律标准。

# 即将到来的ECB决定影响了新客户的接纳

由于即将到来的ECB决定，瑞士和列支敦士登的监管机构对Banque Havilland接受新客户实施了限制，Finma表示，他们正在监控在瑞士获得牌照的银行是否遵守规定。

总之，欧洲中央银行正在准备因David Rowland家族拥有的卢森堡贷款机构Banque Havilland涉嫌合规和反洗钱失败而撤销其经营许可证。决定草案有待ECB董事会批准，通常被视为一个形式性程序。一旦获得批准，该银行将失去在欧洲运营的能力，归因于CSSF的管辖范围。然而，位于ECB监管管辖区外的Banque Havilland分支机构的前景仍不确定。

 **ECB to revoke Banque Havilland's license**  
The European Central Bank (ECB) is preparing to withdraw the operating license for Banque Havilland, a Luxembourg-based lender owned by David Rowland and his family. The bank has faced multiple regulatory probes due to alleged compliance and anti-money laundering failures under its ownership.

**Banque Havilland's history of controversy**  
The bank, previously known as a part of the Icelandic Kaupthing Bank before being bought by the Rowland family in 2009 and renamed after their stately home on Guernsey, has been mired in controversy. It faced fines from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for an investment scheme designed to crash Qatar's currency at the behest of Saudi and Emirati clients.

**ECB draft decision not yet finalized**  
The ECB's draft decision is awaiting approval by its board of governors, which is usually regarded as a formality. Once approved, Banque Havilland will lose its ability to operate in Europe under the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) jurisdiction.

**Uncertainty for branches outside ECB's regulatory jurisdiction**  
The future of Banque Havilland's branches in Dubai, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Monaco remains unclear as they may continue operating under their own local licenses. Swiss regulator Finma is monitoring ongoing compliance with legal standards by the Zurich branch and other banks licensed in Switzerland.

**Pending ECB decision affects new client intake**  
Regulators in Switzerland and Liechtenstein have imposed restrictions on taking on new clients at Banque Havilland due to the pending ECB decision, with Finma stating that they are monitoring compliance by banks licensed in Switzerland.

In summary, the European Central Bank is preparing to revoke the operating license of Luxembourg-based lender Banque Havilland over alleged compliance and anti-money laundering failures under its ownership by David Rowland's family. The draft decision awaits approval from the ECB board of governors, which is usually regarded as a formality. Once approved, the bank will lose its ability to operate in Europe under CSSF jurisdiction. However, the future of Banque Havilland's branches outside the ECB's regulatory jurisdiction remains unclear.
