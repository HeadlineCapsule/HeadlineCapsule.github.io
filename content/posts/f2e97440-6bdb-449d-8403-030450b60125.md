投资者重振“特朗普交易”押注美国债券

**摘要：**
由于唐纳德·特朗普赢得美国大选的预期不断增长，投资者正在重新启动对国债收益率的热门对冲基金交易，通常称为“特朗普交易”。这一策略涉及到预测通货膨胀上升以及特朗普削减税收和支持贸易的关税议程将增加长期政府债券的供应。乔·拜登和特朗普之间的电视辩论进一步加剧了这些预期，导致人们预计短期债券的表现将优于长期债务。

支持这一交易的一个关键因素是相信美国联邦储备委员会可能很快会降低利率，因为通货膨胀接近其目标，这将对短期收益产生负面影响。自辩论以来，“利率上升”的投注已经付出了代价，两年期收益率与十年期收益率相比显著下降。

特朗普获胜对市场的影响将取决于共和党在国会的潜在多数席位及其通过立法的能力。在高关税场景或实施税收减免的情况下，长期债券可能受到通货膨胀预期和增加的财政赤字（需要更多债券发行）的负面影响。

投资者对美国利率下调的乐观情绪日益高涨，因为最近的经济数据显示通货膨胀放缓和失业率上升。然而，人们仍然对美联储降息的确定性以及选举结果 known 的长期时间框架保持谨慎态度。

 **Summary:** 
Investors are reviving a popular hedge fund bet on Treasury yields, often referred to as the "Trump trade," due to growing expectations of Donald Trump winning the US presidential election. This strategy involves anticipating higher inflation and an increased supply of longer-dated government bonds under Trump's tax-cutting and pro-trade tariff agenda. The recent televised debate between Joe Biden and Trump has further fueled these expectations, leading to a rise in bets that short maturity bonds will outperform long-dated debt.

A key factor supporting this trade is the belief that the US Federal Reserve may soon reduce interest rates as inflation approaches its target, which would negatively impact short-term yields. Since the debate, the "steepener" bet has paid off, with a significant drop in the two-year yield compared to the 10-year yield.

The effect of a Trump victory on markets will depend on the Republican party's potential majority in Congress and their ability to pass legislation. In a high-tariff scenario or if tax cuts are implemented, long-dated bonds could be negatively impacted due to inflation expectations and an increased fiscal deficit requiring more bond issuance.

Investors have become more optimistic about US rate cuts following recent economic data showing slowing inflation and rising unemployment rates. However, some caution remains regarding the certainty of Fed rate cuts and the long timeframe until the election outcome is known.
