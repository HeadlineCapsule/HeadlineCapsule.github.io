投资者重振“特朗普交易” 押注美国债券

**投资者重拾“特朗普交易”**

由于人们越来越期待唐纳德·特朗普赢得美国总统选举，投资者正在复兴一种流行的对国债收益率的对冲基金押注，称为“特朗普交易”。这种策略涉及短期债务优于长期债务的表现，其基础是特朗普的政策可能会导致通货膨胀上升以及更长的政府债券供应增加的预期。

乔·拜登和唐纳德·特朗普之间的电视辩论进一步推动了这一投注，因为它提高了特朗普获胜的可能性。此外，人们还期待美国联邦储备委员会将很快降低利率以达到通胀目标，这将对短期收益产生负面影响。自辩论以来，“陡峭化”交易（更陡峭的收益率曲线）取得了成功，两年期收益率下降超过了10年期收益率。

特朗普获胜的可能性及其对市场的影响将取决于共和党在国会中的多数地位，这将影响立法能力。高关税方案可能会导致通胀性减税和增加财政赤字，需要发行更多的长期债券，从而推动收益率上升。

投资者现在预计今年将有两次或三次四分之一点的利率削减，因为美国通货膨胀放缓和失业率上升。对共和党候选人的暗杀未遂事件进一步增加了市场对“陡峭化”交易的兴趣，因为它提高了特朗普总统任期的可能性。

然而，在最近之前，“陡峭化”交易在今年是昂贵的，从1月中旬到6月底，长期国债表现优于短期国债。一些投资者对美联储的利率决定保持谨慎态度，认为围绕它们的决策仍然存在太多的不确定性。

**关键概念：**
- **特朗普交易**：一种对冲基金策略，预测特朗普的政策将导致通货膨胀上升并增加长期政府债券的供应。
- **陡峭化交易**：投资者预计短期债务将优于长期债务，从而导致收益率曲线更陡峭。
- **美联储利率削减**：预期当通货膨胀接近目标水平时，将降低利率，从而对短期收益产生负面影响。

 **Summary:**
Investors are reviving a popular hedge fund bet on Treasury yields, known as the "Trump trade," due to increasing expectations of Donald Trump winning the US presidential election. This strategy involves short-dated debt outperforming longer maturities and is based on anticipation that Trump's policies could lead to higher inflation and a greater supply of long-dated government bonds.

The recent televised debate between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump has further fueled this bet, as it raised the chances of a Trump victory. Additionally, there is an expectation that the US Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates soon to meet inflation targets, which would impact short-term yields negatively. Since the debate, the "steepener" trade (a steeper yield curve) has been successful, with the two-year yield falling more than the 10-year yield.

The outcome of a potential Trump win and its effect on markets will depend on the Republican party's majority in Congress, which would influence legislative capabilities. A high-tariff scenario could lead to inflationary tax cuts and an increased fiscal deficit, requiring more long-dated bonds issuance and driving yields higher.

Investors are now pricing in two or three quarter point rate cuts this year due to slowing US inflation and rising unemployment rates. The attempted assassination of the Republican candidate has further increased market enthusiasamo for the "steepener" trade, as it raises the likelihood of a Trump presidency.

However, steepener trades have been costly this year until recently, with longer-dated Treasuries outperforming short-dated ones from mid-January to late June. Some investors remain cautious about the Fed's rate cut decisions and believe there is still too much uncertainty surrounding them.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Trump trade**: A hedge fund bet on Treasury yields, anticipating higher inflation and a greater supply of long-dated government bonds due to Trump's policies.
- **Steepener trade**: Investors expect short-dated debt to outperform longer maturities, resulting in a steeper yield curve.
- **US Federal Reserve rate cuts**: Anticipated reduction in interest rates as inflation approaches target levels, impacting short-term yields negatively.
