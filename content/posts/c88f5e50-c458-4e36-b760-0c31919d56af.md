巴拿马将关闭臭名昭著的达连缺口，总统发誓

巴拿马新总统誓言关闭达连缺口

周一，巴拿马新任右翼领导人何塞·劳尔·穆利诺（José Raúl Mulino）在就职演说中承诺阻止非法移民通过臭名昭著的危险达连缺口。该路线是前往美国南部边境的热门路径。穆利诺表示，巴拿马将不再是非法移民的过境国，并强调了与移民相关的经济和社会成本。

达连缺口延伸到哥伦比亚，由于拉丁美洲的经济和政治危机，去年已有超过50万次穿越。移民在这一危险的旅程中经常面临强奸、谋杀和事故。美国总统乔·拜登（Joe Biden）的政府正在向该地区各国政府施压，要求他们打击非法流动，因为他寻求11月的连任。

穆利诺访问了丛林边缘的一个移民营地，并与他的安全部长讨论了潜在的措施，包括建立新的检查站来拘留非法移民并关闭丛林中的路径。美国已与巴拿马签署谅解备忘录，共同减少通过达连缺口走私移民的人数。

穆利诺面临着急迫的挑战，包括增长大幅放缓、公共财政薄弱以及为国家的运河寻找新的水源。他还计划着手进行社会保障改革，以在不到一年的时间内避免系统崩溃。

 **Panama's New President Vows to Close Darién Gap**  

In his inauguration speech on Monday, Panama’s new right-wing leader José Raúl Mulino pledged to halt illegal immigration through the notorious and dangerous **Darién Gap**. The route is a popular path for people headed towards the southern US border. Mulino stated that Panama will no longer be a transit country for illegals, emphasizing the economic and social costs associated with migration.

The Darién Gap stretches into Colombia and has seen over half a million crossings last year due to economic and political crises in Latin America. Migrants often face rape, murder, and accidents on this perilous journey. The US President Joe Biden's administration is pressuring governments across the region to crack down on illegal movement as he seeks re-election in November.

Mulino visited a migrant camp at the edge of the jungle and discussed potential measures with his security minister, including erecting new checkpoints where illegal migrants would be detained and closing paths through the jungle. The US has signed a memorandum of understanding with Panama to jointly reduce the number of migrants being smuggled through the Darién Gap.

Mulino faces urgent challenges, including a sharp slowdown in growth, weak public finances, and finding a new water source for the country's canal. He also plans to embark on social security reform to avoid system collapse within less than a year.
