中国调查食用油是否被装在未清洗的燃料罐车里运输

# 中国的食品安全丑闻：用未清洗的燃料运输车运输食油

- 中国正在调查北京新闻报道的指控，即燃料运输车在没有清洗的情况下被用于运输食油。在一名匿名举报人提供的视频证据中，展示了多辆卡车同时运输食用油和毒性液体。

**要点：**

1. 指控在同一个油箱中混合毒性液体和食用液体引起了人们对食品安全的担忧，司机承认他们在运输不同类型货物时不会清洗油箱。
2. 中国国务院宣布了一项由多个机构共同参与的调查，其中包括食品安全委员会，以检查和解决与在燃料运输车中运输食油相关的问题。
3. 涉事的中国国有食品公司**中粮集团**已在其运营中开展了内部检查，并承诺对任何违反法规的行为者进行黑名单处理。
4. 之前涉及不卫生运输实践的事件包括 2011 年的一起丑闻，当时有人在街沟中收集食油进行回收和转售。
5. 中国多年来一直面临着食品安全丑闻，例如 2008 年有毒奶粉导致婴儿生病和死亡、2014 年向快餐店供应过期肉类以及 2018 年分发不合格疫苗等。
6. 最新发生的丑闻导致中国电子商务平台上的进口食油销售量增加，因为消费者对国内制造产品失去了信心。

**结论：**
最近的食品安全丑闻暴露了中国在确保安全可靠的食品供应链方面面临的挑战。中国政府已发起联合调查以解决这些问题，而消费者则因对国产商品缺乏信任而转向进口商品。

 **China's Food Safety Scandal: Cooking Oil Transported in Unwashed Fuel Tankers**

- China is investigating allegations that fuel tankers were used to transport cooking oil without being cleaned, as reported by state-backed Beijing News. The investigation was prompted after an undercover video showed numerous trucks carrying both edible and toxic liquids.

**Key Points:**

1. **Allegations of mixing toxic and edible liquids** in the same tankers have raised concerns about food safety, with drivers admitting that they do not clean their tanks when switching between hauling different types of cargo.
2. The Chinese state council announced a joint investigation led by multiple agencies, including the food safety commission, to examine and address these issues related to cooking oil transportation in tankers.
3. **Sinograin**, China's state-owned food company implicated in the report, has launched an internal inspection across its operations and pledged to blacklist any violators of regulations.
4. Previous incidents involving unsanitary transport practices include a 2011 scandal where cooking oil was collected from street gutters for recycling and resale.
5. China has faced numerous food safety scandals over the years, such as tainted milk powder in 2008 causing illnesses and deaths among infants, expired meat supplied to fast-food outlets in 2014, and faulty vaccines distributed in 2018.
6. The latest scandal has led to increased sales of imported cooking oil on Chinese ecommerce platforms as consumers lose trust in domestically manufactured products.

**Conclusion:**
The recent food safety scandal involving the transportation of cooking oil in unwashed fuel tankers highlights China's ongoing struggle with ensuring safe and reliable food supply chains. The Chinese government has initiated a joint investigation to address these concerns, while consumers are increasingly turning towards imported products due to widespread distrust in domestically manufactured goods.
