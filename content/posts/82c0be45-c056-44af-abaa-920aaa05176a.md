萨瓦德尔银行董事长警告说，BBVA的收购可能存在反垄断威胁。

# 西班牙银行业面临反垄断监管挑战

**文章摘要**：萨瓦德尔银行（Banco Sabadell）首席执行官警告称，在BBVA收购案中，西班牙银行业可能面临反垄断监管挑战。此次收购可能导致市场竞争问题，因为该行业已经高度集中。

**关键要点**：

1. **BBVA对萨瓦德尔银行的收购** 价值120亿欧元，将是今年欧洲银行业最大的交易，但可能因竞争问题面临监管障碍。

2. 西班牙竞争事务委员会（CNMC）可能要求采取反垄断补救措施，例如剥离部分萨瓦德尔银行的小微企业业务，以获得批准。

3. BBVA认为此次收购是扩大西班牙中小客户基础的机会，而冈萨雷斯-布伊诺（González-Bueno）警告称，即使没有采取极端的反垄断补救措施，也可能出现客户流失，因为他们担心业务多样化问题。

4. 尽管萨瓦德尔银行规模较小，但在西班牙小微企业市场上的份额却较大（12.7%），高于BBVA的11.5%。

5. BBVA承诺在收购后至少12个月内维持所有中小企业的工作资本设施，认为一个更加整合的银行业可以降低借贷成本。

 **Article Summary**: Banco Sabadell's CEO warns of antitrust threat to BBVA takeover bid. The Spanish banking industry is facing a potential acquisition by BBVA, which could lead to significant competition issues due to the already concentrated market. César González-Bueno, chief executive of Banco Sabadell, expressed concerns that regulatory approval may require BBVA to divest part of its SME business in order to secure antitrust remedies.

**Key Points**:
1. **BBVA's bid for Banco Sabadell** valued at €12bn and would be the largest deal in European banking this year, but faces potential regulatory hurdles due to competition concerns.
2. The Spanish competition authority (CNMC) may request antitrust remedies such as divestment of part of Banco Sabadell's SME business for approval.
3. BBVA sees the acquisition as an opportunity to expand its small and mid-sized client base in Spain, while González-Bueno warns that even without drastic antitrust remedies, there could be customer exodus due to diversification concerns.
4. Despite being a smaller business, Banco Sabadell holds a larger share of the Spanish SME market (12.7%) compared to BBVA's 11.5%.
5. BBVA has pledged to maintain working capital facilities for all small and medium-sized companies for at least 12 months post-acquisition, arguing that a more consolidated banking sector can lead to lower borrowing costs.
