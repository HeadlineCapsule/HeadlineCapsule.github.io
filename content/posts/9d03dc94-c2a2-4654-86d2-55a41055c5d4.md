大卫·埃利斯说，派拉蒙将成为一个“媒体和科技”公司。

**文章摘要：**

大卫·埃利斯（David Ellison）计划将派拉蒙（Paramount）打造成一家现代媒体和科技公司，使其能够挑战Netflix。甲骨文（Oracle）创始人拉里·埃利斯（Larry Ellison）的儿子认为技术是这家陷入困境的制片厂转型的关键，因为它正在适应流媒体和人工智能等行业变化。

埃利斯与沙里·雷德斯顿（Shari Redstone）达成协议，将他的制片厂Skydance与派拉蒙合并，在经过艰难的谈判后过渡控制权。这项交易预计将于明年完成，新的派拉蒙企业价值将达到280亿美元。

派拉蒙的困境始于2020年，当时雷德斯顿决定大力投资派拉蒙+流媒体服务。尽管该平台投入了数十亿美元，但仍然亏损，观众稀少，且受到技术故障和广告投诉的困扰。埃利斯计划重建派拉蒙+背后的技术，通过改进其推荐引擎来提高其用户友好性。

埃利斯打算与父亲的公司合作，该公司是云计算领域的领导者，以提高效率并降低成本。Skydance已经在其动画业务中使用云技术，使生产过程能够以较低的成本虚拟化完成。

前NBC首席执行官、即将成为合并后新公司总裁的杰夫·谢尔（Jeff Shell）表示，派拉蒙+将探索与其他流媒体服务的合作伙伴关系和潜在捆绑协议，以帮助削减成本并减少客户流失。他还提到Netflix在技术方面目前表现优于其他平台。

由于流媒体的流行导致派拉蒙的有线电视网络急剧下降，派拉蒙一直处于挣扎之中。但谢尔表示，一些资产可以战略性出售。然而，他看到了CBS网络的增长潜力，尤其是在拥有NFL比赛和欧足联冠军联赛版权的体育领域。

RedBird Capital Partners创始人杰里·卡迪纳莱（Gerry Cardinale）拒绝了任何关于他的私募股权公司试图拆分派拉蒙的想法。他认为这个计划对于保护一个超过100年的遗产并振兴它至关重要。

**要点：**
- 大卫·埃利斯计划利用技术，尤其是流媒体和人工智能领域的技术，将派拉蒙打造成一家能够挑战Netflix的媒体和科技巨头。
- Skydance与派拉蒙之间的协议预计将于明年完成，企业价值为280亿美元。
- 派拉蒙+面临着亏损、观众稀少、技术故障和广告投诉等困境，尽管投入了大量资金。
- 埃利斯计划改进派拉蒙+的推荐引擎，以提高用户体验。
- Skydance在动画业务中使用云

 **Summary of Article:**

David Ellison plans to transform Paramount into a modern media and tech company capable of challenging Netflix. The son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison believes technology is crucial for the struggling studio's fortunes, as it adapts to industry shifts like streaming and AI. 

Ellison reached an agreement with Shari Redstone to combine his production studio Skydance with Paramount, transitioning control from Redstone after a grueling negotiation process. The deal is expected to close next year, giving the new Paramount an enterprise value of $28 billion. 

Paramount's struggles began in 202amo when Redstone decided to invest heavily in the Paramount+ streaming service. Despite billions spent on the platform, it remains unprofitable with a sparse audience and complaints about glitchy technology and advertisements. Ellison plans to rebuild the technology behind Paramount+ to make it more consumer-friendly by improving its recommendation engine.

Ellison intends to work with his father's company, which is a leader in cloud computing, to boost efficiency and reduce costs. Skydance already uses cloud technology in its animation business, allowing production processes to be done virtually at lower costs. 

Jeff Shell, the former CEO of NBC who will become president of the newly combined company, said Paramount+ will explore partnerships with other streaming services and potential bundling agreements to help cut costs and decrease customer churn. He also mentioned that Netflix is currently doing technology well compared to other platforms.

Paramount has struggled as its cable networks fell into steep decline due to the popularity of streaming, but Shell said some assets could be sold strategically. However, he sees CBS network as a growth opportunity, particularly in sports where it holds rights to NFL games and Uefa Champions League. 

Gerry Cardinale, founder of RedBird Capital Partners backing Skydance's deal, rejected any ideas that his private equity company had designs on breaking up Paramount. He believes the plan is critical for preserving a legacy over 100 years old and rejuvenating it.
