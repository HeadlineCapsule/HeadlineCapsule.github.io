美国参议员鲍勃·梅内德斯在贿赂审判中被判有罪

美国参议员鲍勃·梅嫩德斯（Bob Menendez）在贿赂审判中被判有罪。
- 新泽西州的民主党人鲍勃·梅嫩德斯（Bob Menendez）参议员，曾经是一位强大的民主党人，已被判在所有16项贿赂指控中成立。这些指控包括接受金条、现金、豪华汽车，以及作为外国政府的代理人行事以换取他在国会的影响力。
- 定罪：纽约的一个陪审团裁定梅嫩德斯与共同被告瓦埃尔·哈纳（Wael Hana）和弗雷德·戴比尔斯（Fred Daibes）有罪。
- 呼吁辞职：在定罪之后，民主党领袖查克·舒默（Chuck Schumer）和迪克·德宾（Dick Durbin）呼吁梅嫩德斯在11月的连任竞选之前辞职。新泽西州州长菲尔·墨菲（Phil Murphy）也敦促他辞职或面临参议院的驱逐。
- 之前的审判尝试：这并不是梅嫩德斯第一次与联邦检察官发生冲突，因为他在2015年曾经因腐败指控被审判，但该案由于陪审团陷入僵局而撤销。
- 背景和职业生涯：梅嫩德斯于1993年被选为美国众议院代表，并于2006年当选为美国参议员。他曾在奥巴马政府中担任过多个重要职位，包括参议院外交关系委员会主席。

* '''Microbial cellulose''' (also called '''nanocellulose''') is a form of edible, transparent cellulose produced by some bacteria. It is used in some kinds of surgical dressings. Some companies are looking at producing plastic-free bio packaging from it.
* '''Microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates''' (PHA) are thermoplastic polymers produced by many bacteria as carbon and energy storage compounds.
* '''Polysaccharide''' capsules, as in ''Bacteroides gingivalis'' help bacteria to cause severe periodontal disease and increase their pathogenicity.  Capsules may be made from proteoglycans or hyaluronic acid.
* '''Exopolysaccharides''' (EPS) are sugar-based polymers synthesized by many bacteria, including both gram-positive ''Streptococcus mutans'' and pathogenic ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''. They live in the environment as biofilms, sometimes referred to as EPS ''capsules'', although a capsule is actually a distinct concept.
* '''Lipopolysaccuarides''' (LPS) are large molecules consisting of polysaccharide chains covalently linked to lipids. They are found in the outer plasma membrane of gram-negative bacteria, where they act as structural components and protect against host defenses by inhibiting the complement-mediated lysis.
* '''Lipopeptides''' (LPs) are a class of compounds synthesized by some Bacillus species. They have anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-parasitar activities. The Baclofilin C2 is one example of an LP that has been used to develop new antibiotics effective on resistant bacteria.
* '''Bacteriocins''' are tpye of proteins secreted by bacteria that kill or inhibit the growth of closely related bacter
