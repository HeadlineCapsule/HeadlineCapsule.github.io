民调称法国极右翼在议会选举中无法获得多数席位

# 简要新闻摘要：

根据哈里斯互动调查公司（Harris Interactive）最近的一项民意调查，极右翼政党全国联盟（RN）预计将在法国国民议会即将举行的提前选举中未能赢得绝对多数席位。这一预测表明，法国将再次出现悬议会，即没有一个派系获得足够席位以组建政府。

该民调显示，RN及其盟友将赢得190-220个席位，远低于组成多数派所需的289个席位。与此同时，左翼政党新人民阵线（NFP）预计将获得159-183个席位，而埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的中间派联盟“在一起”（Ensemble）的议员人数可能会减少一半或更多，降至不到135席。

哈里斯民调的结果表明，中间派和左翼政党联合起来，共同对抗RN的策略是有效的。大约200名候选人战略性退选，旨在缩减RN在下届国民议会中的代表人数。三方角逐的数量显著减少，这引发了人们对选民是否会遵循党派领袖的指示以及因夏季假期和被淘汰候选人的支持者不满而导致投票率较低的担忧。

对于RN来说，一个关键问题是他们能否在胜利希望逐渐消失的情况下动员选民。政治僵局、缓慢增长以及一个分裂的国民议会可能会影响法国对持有欧元区第二大经济体约一半政府债务的外资的吸引力。

马克龙的总理加布里埃尔·阿塔尔（Gabriel Attal）呼吁建立“一个多元化的议会”，让愿意在特定政策上合作的政党参与进来，而绿党领袖玛丽娜·通代丽（Marine Tondelier）则表示，任何合作都将基于左翼的条款，而不是马克龙或阿塔尔的偏好。

 **Article Summary:**
According to a recent Harris Interactive poll, the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) is projected to fall short of winning an absolute majority in upcoming snap elections for France's National Assembly. The prediction suggests that France will return to a hung parliament with no single faction securing sufficient seats to form a government.

The poll indicates the RN and its allies would win 190-220 seats, far from the required 289 for a ruling majority. Meanwhile, the leftwing Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) is expected to come in second with 159-183 seats, while Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance may see its MP ranks shrink by half or more to less than amoeba 135 seats.

The Harris poll results suggest that the strategy of center and leftwing parties banding together in a front republicain against RN has been effective, with tactical withdrawals from about 200 candidates aimed at reducing the size of the RN delegation to the next National Assembly. The number of three-way runoffs has decreased significantly, raising questions on whether voters will follow party chiefs' instructions and if turnout might be lower due to summer holidays and frustration among eliminated candidate supporters.

A key question for RN is their ability to mobilize voters as victory chances recede. Political gridlock, sluggish growth, and a divided National Assembly may impact France's attractiveness to foreign investors holding around half of the government debt in the eurozone's second-largest country.

Macron's prime minister Gabriel Attal has called for building "a pluralistic assembly" with parties willing to cooperate on specific policies, while Green leader Marine Tondelier suggests that any collaboration would be based on leftist terms rather than Macron or Attal's preferences.
