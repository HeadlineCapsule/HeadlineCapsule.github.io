# AI Boom Drives Global Chip Race and China's Rise 


## Navigating the AI Boom: China's Chips, Intel's Struggle, and Nvidia's Reign

The global landscape of artificial intelligence is shifting rapidly, driven by innovation, geopolitical tensions, and fierce competition. This week's curated articles offer a glimpse into these dynamics, exploring China's unique approach to AI chip regulation, the challenges facing US chip giant Intel, and Nvidia's seemingly unstoppable rise in the world of AI processors.

## Chinese Banks: TLAC Bonds with Government Support?


While global regulations aim to protect against bank failures through Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) bonds, China's largest banks are testing a new approach. Analysts predict Beijing will likely step in to support these bonds even though they are designed to absorb losses.  The potential for government intervention raises questions about the true effectiveness of TLAC as a risk mitigation tool in China.
"We expect a very high probability of state support to prevent default and below-average recoveries,” notes Vivian Xue, an analyst at Fitch Ratings.

## Nvidia's AI Chips: Cheap and Plentiful in China


Despite US export restrictions, Nvidia's cutting-edge AI processors are readily available in China at surprisingly low prices. This suggests a robust black market for smuggled chips is thriving, undercutting Washington's efforts to limit China's access to advanced AI technology.  A Chinese start-up founder reveals that "the big players have to think about compliance, so they are at a disadvantage. They don’t want to use smuggled chips," indicating the ease with which these powerful processors can be obtained through unofficial channels.

## Intel: Navigating a Crisis


Intel, once the world's leading chipmaker, is grappling with a multitude of challenges as it falls behind rivals like Nvidia and AMD in the AI processor market.  Facing plunging share prices, mass layoffs, and high manufacturing costs, CEO Pat Gelsinger is under pressure to deliver results. A recent report suggests Intel may consider drastic measures, including selling its foundry business or even scrapping some factory projects.

Donald Trump's sentencing over his "hush money" conviction has been postponed until after the US presidential election on November 5. Judge Juan Merchan granted Trump's request, setting a new sentencing date for November 26. The delay removes a significant legal flashpoint from Trump's calendar before the election. Trump claimed the case was a "political attack" against him by opponents trying to interfere with his campaign.

Trump was found guilty in May of 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records and concealing "hush money" payments. He has also faced other criminal indictments, including attempts to interfere with the ratification of the 2020 election results and retention of classified documents.

Kamala Harris's campaign raised **$361mn** in August, surpassing Donald Trump's haul of **$130mn**, with a total cash on hand of **$404mn** compared to Trump's **$295mn**. This financial advantage extends into the final two months of the US presidential race. The Democratic candidate has raised over **$615mn** since July, while Trump has received significant support from individual donors, including **$125mn** from Tim Mellon. Harris now enters the autumn with a significant advertising advantage, with pro-Harris groups booking **$380mn** in ads compared to Trump's **$195mn**.

Kamala Harris is focusing her presidential campaign on voters in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state with 19 Electoral College votes. She will make her second visit to western Pennsylvania this week and remains in the state throughout the weekend as she prepares for a debate with Donald Trump. Harris and Trump are neck and neck in polls, with both candidates courting blue-collar votes by opposing a proposed $15bn takeover of US Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel.

**The winner of Pennsylvania has won the White House in 10 of the past 12 presidential elections**, with margins of victory often being small. Harris is seen as having an advantage over Trump due to her newer and fresher face, but the outcome remains uncertain. **The state's vote will ultimately be decided by voters in the middle of the income bracket**.

**Top Federal Reserve officials have left the door open for large interest rate cuts if data worsens**. Despite a mixed jobs report, Fed officials signaled caution at their meeting this month. **Governor Christopher Waller and President John Williams endorsed rate cuts**, citing "downside risks" and a softening labor market. However, they emphasized that the economy is still performing well and rate cuts would be done carefully. **Market expectations for a 0.5 percentage point cut in September were sparked**, but analysts warned it was an overreaction. The Fed will meet on September 17-18 to discuss interest rates.

OnlyFans, a UK-based subscription streaming platform for sex workers, sports stars, and celebrities, has paid **$630mn** to its owner, Leonid Radvinsky, since last year's start. The company paid **$6.6bn** to content creators in 2023, with revenues growing by **20%** to over $1.3bn. OnlyFans' user base expanded significantly, with **4.1mn** creator accounts and **305mn** fan accounts. Pre-tax profits rose to **$657mn**, with a further **$159mn** paid to Radvinsky in dividends since the year's end. The platform's CEO highlighted its growth as a leading digital entertainment company.

UK pension funds have a historic low allocation to British stocks, with just 4.4% of assets held in domestic equities. This is lower than the global average of 10.1%. The UK's corporate defined-benefit pension schemes have only 13% invested in equities and 1.4% in domestic equities. **Defined-contribution schemes have an allocation of 8% to UK stocks**, which is roughly half the average of others outside of the US. The report suggests that pension funds could double their allocation to UK stocks, adding around £100bn in investment, while still being within international norms.

**Nick Pickles, vice-president of global affairs at X, is leaving the social media platform after a decade.**

Pickles announced his departure on Thursday, citing an "incredible journey" and a decision made several months ago. He will be working with CEO Linda Yaccarino through the transition, but no successor or next move has been named.

During his tenure, Pickles was involved in multiple political battles and engaged with regulators worldwide, defending X's policies against governments such as Brazil, Turkey, India, and Australia. He emphasized the importance of protecting the open internet and press freedom globally.

Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov has criticized French authorities for their "misguided approach" in charging him personally over alleged failures to address criminal content on the platform. Durov was detained and charged after arriving in France, despite claiming he had previously offered assistance to French authorities. He argued that it is standard practice to pursue legal action against a company, not its CEO, when addressing online crimes. Durov promised to improve Telegram's response to criminals using the service, but stated the company will leave markets incompatible with its principles if necessary. **French authorities have accused Durov of enabling money laundering, drug trafficking, and child sexual abuse**.

Former VW CEO Herbert Diess pushed back against criticism over his hybrid car strategy, saying public backing for hybrids was too weak in Germany. Despite union chair Daniela Cavallo accusing him of leaving the company "empty-handed", Diess claimed to have an "excellent portfolio" of plug-in hybrids. He argued that further investment wouldn't be possible due to hybrid technology being "discredited" by public discussion and some politicians. **Hybrid sales were 3% of VW's first-half sales, while full hybrids accounted for 41% at Toyota**.

US stocks suffered their worst week in over a year, with the S&P 500 dropping 4.2% and the Nasdaq Composite falling 5.8%. The declines followed weaker-than-expected payroll data, which showed US employers added 142,000 jobs in August, below forecasts of 160,000. Top Fed officials hinted at potential interest rate cuts, sending yields lower. Global stock markets were also volatile, with Europe's Stoxx 600 and France's Cac 40 both falling around 1%. Oil prices hit their lowest levels of the year despite Opec+ agreeing to delay production increases.

**Tech and crypto groups are rushing to launch new stablecoins, but industry experts warn that many may not survive.**

Technology and crypto companies have launched new stablecoins, following Ripple and PayPal's attempts to cash in on the recovering stablecoin market, which has swelled to a record $169bn of coins in circulation. However, critics say most lack distinguishing features from industry giants Tether and Circle, and will likely burn out. The primary use for these coins is trading other cryptocurrencies or as an alternative store of value. Regulated stablecoins may offer a new use case, but the market remains largely focused on crypto trading.

Darktrace chief executive Poppy Gustafsson is stepping down ahead of the company's acquisition by US private equity group Thoma Bravo. Jill Popelka, chief operating officer, will take over as CEO and rejoin the board. The deal values Darktrace at £4.3bn. **Gustafsson will become a non-executive director after the completion of the transaction**. Darktrace has faced challenges on the public markets, including allegations of simulated sales and incorrect bookings. The company expects final foreign regulatory approval this month, with completion anticipated shortly afterwards.

The Biden administration is developing plans to set up a US sovereign wealth fund, a move away from Washington's economic orthodoxy as it competes with deep-pocketed geopolitical rivals. **Senior members of the administration have been working on the plans "quietly" in recent months**. The fund would make big investments in strategic sectors, such as supply chains and specialized industries, to advance US interests. This is a break from the past when Washington viewed sovereign wealth funds as unfair economic competition.

Opec+ members have delayed planned increases to oil production for at least two months as demand indications were weak. The group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, was due to begin unwinding voluntary output cuts from October but the curbs will now remain in place until December 1. This decision is aimed at propping up prices that have fallen to their lowest levels this year. **The planned increases would have lifted production by 180,000 barrels a day** and were part of plans for a gradual unwinding of 2.2mn of voluntary cuts over the next 12 months.

UK water companies face a tough market for new debt following the crisis at Thames Water. Investors are demanding higher premiums for water bonds, raising corporate borrowing costs and concerns that the industry will need to divert more customer bills to service its £64bn debt mountain. Despite this, companies like Welsh Water and Anglian Water have marketed or issued new sterling debt, with investors seeking cheaper prices. The crisis at Thames has left it in breach of licensing conditions, and industry lobby group Water UK warns that Ofwat's proposed regulatory regime will make it impossible for the sector to attract investment needed. **Investors are demanding higher premiums for water bonds**.

NatWest chair Rick Haythornthwaite's ties to PetroSaudi International have come under scrutiny after a Swiss court convicted its executives of embezzling $1.8bn from Malaysia's 1MDB wealth fund. **Haythornthwaite claimed to work only one hour a week** at the company, despite documents suggesting a bigger commitment. He stayed in his role through the period when PetroSaudi was being investigated, but says he had no knowledge of the corruption. NatWest considered Haythornthwaite's PetroSaudi role during his selection and concluded he played no role in its management.

**UK regulators accuse Google of anti-competitive behavior in advertising**. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising, favoring its own services over rivals. This could harm thousands of UK publishers and advertisers by overcharging them and suppressing competition. The CMA is considering what measures to take against Google, which faces a similar lawsuit in the US. **Google's ad exchange, AdX, is accused of providing exclusive access to advertisers**.

Japan is facing its worst rice shortage in 30 years due to a combination of factors including extreme weather, an influx of tourists, and decades of misguided agricultural policy. **Private sector inventories are at their lowest level since 1999**, and prices have surged by up to 60% in the past year. The government has limited customers to one bag of rice per time amid shortages, which have been variously blamed on tourism and weather conditions, rather than addressing the underlying issues.

The US bond yield curve has inverted, with short-term yields falling below long-term yields, a move that some analysts believe could herald an imminent economic downturn. However, investors and strategists are split on what this means, with some speculating it could mean better news about the economy, while others say it may mean a downturn is now imminent. The bond market has been sending this signal almost continuously for the past two years, but investors expect interest rate cuts in recent weeks, which has led to a brief un-inversion of the yield curve. **The Fed is expected to cut rates later this month and additional cuts are priced in by the end of December**.

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is auctioning off stakes in eight teams for its The Hundred short-form tournament, hoping to raise up to £500mn. Proceeds will be distributed among English cricket's county teams to pay off debt and invest in new revenue sources. The ECB expects TV revenue to treble by 2032, with sponsorship revenue forecasted to grow from £9mn to over £80mn.

**The Hundred format**, where each team plays 100 balls, is unique and aimed at attracting a new audience to cricket. However, critics argue that it has diverted attention away from traditional test cricket and added to the overcrowded match calendar.

**Key highlights:**

* TV revenue expected to treble by 2032
* Sponsorship revenue forecasted to grow significantly
* Proceeds will be distributed among English cricket's county teams

TPG is in talks to buy a stake in Vinted, Europe's largest second-hand fashion site, at a €5bn valuation. This would be an increased valuation against the backdrop of turbulent venture capital markets. Vinted has seen rapid growth, with sales increasing by 61% to €596mn last year, and made a net profit of €18mn. The company is positioning itself as Europe's leading player in sustainable fashion, with plans to expand beyond being a marketplace. **TPG's investment would underscore the huge increase in interest in second-hand goods**.

Morgan Stanley has agreed to pay $2mn to settle allegations that it failed to ensure trades completed for a former top executive of First Republic Bank were not based on insider information. The settlement does not name the executive, but matches stock sales made by First Republic's founder and former chair James Herbert II in February-March 2023. Morgan Stanley's fraud detection team was deemed woefully inadequate, lacking basic internet search skills. **No charges have been brought against Herbert or other bank executives**. The settlement marks the first big outcome from last year's regional banking turmoil.

A US-Turkish dual citizen, Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was shot dead by Israeli forces while protesting against Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank on Friday. Eygi's death comes at a time of high tensions between Turkey and Israel over the war in Gaza. The Israeli military said its forces had fired towards the demonstration after rocks were thrown. This is the third high-profile killing blamed on Israeli forces of a US citizen in the West Bank in recent years. **Over 30 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli raids, with more than 630 Palestinians killed since Hamas's October 7 attack**
