# Economic Tides Shift as Central Banks React
A trifecta of economic stories has emerged, revealing a complex web of central bank reactions, market shifts, and technological investments.

## China's Bond Yields Hit Record Lows Amid Deflation Fears
Chinese bond yields have plummeted to record lows as investors defy warnings from the People's Bank of China. The yield on the 10-year bond fell to 2.13%, while 30-year note yields dropped to 2.37%. Despite concerns over a potential bubble, investors are betting on further rate cuts.

"We're seeing a classic case of a self-reinforcing cycle," said Larry Hu, China economist at Macquarie in Hong Kong. "Investors are pricing in more rate cuts, which is driving down yields, and that's making the PBoC's job even harder."

## US Labour Market Cools as Fed Signals Rate Cut
The US labour market has cooled more than expected, adding 114,000 jobs in July. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, prompting traders to increase bets on a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this year.

"The main issue right now is that the PBoC's credibility isn't strong enough," said Austan Goolsbee, Chicago Fed president and alternate voting member on the Fed's policy-setting committee. "We never want to overreact to one month's data, but if unemployment is going to go up higher than 4.1%, that's the kind of thing the Fed has to respond to."

## Big Tech Groups Say AI Spending Spree Is Just Beginning
Big Tech companies have boosted their capital spending by 50% to more than $100 billion this year, as they race to build infrastructure supporting artificial intelligence.

"At this point, I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late," said Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg. "We're going through a transition, and the risk of underinvesting in AI is dramatically higher than overinvesting."

Kamala Harris has officially won the Democratic presidential nomination, becoming the first Black woman to lead a major party ticket in a US presidential election. Her campaign raised $310mn in July, surpassing Donald Trump's campaign funds. Harris's fundraising surge marks the latest twist in a battle for campaign funds that has accompanied the race for the White House this year. The Democratic convention and a rally with her running mate will be opportunities to further boost her fundraising.

The Federal Reserve is under fire for its decision not to lower borrowing costs in July, despite a sharper-than-expected fall in US jobs growth. The employment report showed a 114,000 job gain, significantly lower than the 215,000 average over the past 12 months. Economists and politicians are accusing the Fed of moving too slowly, risking a recession. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, triggering the Sahm Rule, which links the start of a recession to a rise in the jobless rate. Traders now expect at least two half-point cuts this year. **[Jobs growth](#)**, [Federal Reserve](#), [recession](#)

President Emmanuel Macron defended Thomas Jolly, artistic director of the Paris Olympic Games' opening ceremony, after he reported online harassment over parts of the parade that angered conservatives and Christians. Prosecutors investigated Jolly's allegations of death threats and hateful messages due to his sexual orientation and "wrongly assumed Israeli origins". Macron praised the ceremony as an "audacious" performance that made France proud. Conservative politicians and religious groups criticized a scene featuring drag queens and a bacchanalian scene, calling it insulting and mocking Christianity.

The US has declared Edmundo González the winner of Venezuela's disputed presidential election, citing "deeply flawed" official results favoring President Nicolás Maduro. The opposition collected voting records from polling stations and published online evidence, declaring González the victor with 7.1mn votes to Maduro's 3.2mn. The US calls for Maduro's release of arrested protesters and protection of González and opposition leader María Corina Machado, who is in hiding. Maduro refers to González as "Guaidó 2.0" and has launched a crackdown on nationwide protests.

A Delaware judge is considering whether to reinstate Elon Musk's record $56bn pay package, invalidated earlier this year due to a breach of fiduciary duty by Tesla's board. The judge expressed scepticism about a shareholder vote in June that reapproved the package, calling it a "risky legal strategy". Lawyers for Tesla argued that the vote should give grounds to reverse course and make new law, but the judge noted that shareholders could simply craft a new pay scheme if they want to approve Musk's compensation.

Revolut, a fintech company, has informed staff that it is launching a share sale at a valuation of $45 billion. The sale will allow employees who have been with the company for at least a year to sell up to 20% of their vested shares at $865.42 per share. This move would cement Revolut's status as Europe's most valuable start-up and one of the UK's most valuable banks. The company has around 7,000 employees and operates in 45mn customers globally.

Wall Street stocks declined dramatically, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closing down 2.3%, amid weak economic data and corporate earnings indicating a slowdown in the US economy. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell below 4% for the first time in six months, as investors sought safe-haven assets due to concerns about inflation and geopolitical tensions. Small cap stocks also weakened, with the Russell 2000 index losing 3%, while bond yields sank due to expectations of three quarter-point rate cuts by the end of the year.

Russians released in prisoner swap call for others to be freed. Three prominent Russian political prisoners, Ilya Yashin, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and Andrei Pivovarov, were released on Thursday after the largest swap of its kind since the cold war. They thanked Germany and the US for their efforts, but called for many hundreds of prisoners of conscience still in Russia to be freed. The prisoners emphasized that many ordinary Russians oppose the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and remain in jail. They urged the west to hear the voices of those inside Russia who opposed the war.

**Key entities:**

* Ilya Yashin
* Vladimir Kara-Murza
* Andrei Pivovarov
* Germany
* US

Commodities such as copper, aluminium, lead, zinc, and corn have seen significant price drops due to weak Chinese demand sentiment and a lack of policy support from the country's authorities. Traders have unwound their bullish positions, cutting around $41bn of bets on natural resources. Copper prices have fallen nearly 20% from their record high in May, while corn has dropped to its lowest level since October 2020. Analysts attribute the sell-off to disappointing growth in China and oversupplied markets. The outlook for commodities is weak, with many expecting prices to continue falling in the coming months.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have sued TikTok and its Chinese parent ByteDance over widespread violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The lawsuit alleges that TikTok allowed children under 13 to create accounts, share content with adults, and collect personal information without parental consent. The FTC chair stated that TikTok knowingly violated kids' privacy, threatening millions of children's safety. TikTok disputes the allegations, stating it offers age-appropriate experiences with safeguards.

Google has hired the founders of chatbot maker Character.AI, including Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, and licensed its models. This is part of a series of deals where Big Tech companies have acquired teams and technology from promising start-ups. The deal positions Character.AI for continued success in the future, with Character.AI's team remaining at the company to continue building their product and serving users. Google's AI research division, DeepMind, will benefit from Shazeer's expertise in developing large language models and chatbots.

US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has withdrawn plea deals for three accused plotters behind the 9/11 terror attacks, including Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded at least 183 times by the CIA. The decision comes just two days after the Pentagon announced the agreements with the military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay. Austin reserved authority to enter into such decisions, citing the significance of the case. The move has sparked a backlash from Republicans and criticism from families of the 9/11 victims.

The US is deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East in response to a potential Iranian attack on Israel. This move comes amid growing concerns that Iran and its proxy forces are set to retaliate for the killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Lebanese Hizbollah commander Fuad Shukr. The US has urged a de-escalation of regional tensions and a ceasefire in Gaza. The UK is also increasing its military presence in the region, with Defence Secretary John Healey visiting Israel. **Iran**, **Israel**, and **US** are key entities in this scenario.
