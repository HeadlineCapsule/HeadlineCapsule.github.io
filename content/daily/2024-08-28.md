# Tech Giants Navigate AI Boom and Market Shifts 


#  Navigating a Shifting Tech Landscape

This week's tech landscape is marked by both challenges and opportunities. From the turbulence at Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings to the AI-driven transformation sweeping through Swedish fintech Klarna, and the emergence of new contenders vying for dominance in the AI chip market, there's much to unpack. Join us as we delve into these intriguing developments shaping the future of technology.

##  PDD Takes a Hit

 Chinese retailer PDD Holdings, parent company of Pinduoduo and Temu, saw its shares plummet following a warning of "inevitable" profit decline. The company is grappling with intensifying competition both in China and internationally, while also navigating Beijing's focus on high-end manufacturing.  PDD executives emphasized their commitment to "high-quality development," echoing the Chinese government's current priorities.

The company plans to invest Rmb10bn ($1.4bn) over the next year to reduce fees for "high-quality merchants" and create a more sustainable platform ecosystem. Despite reporting a 144% rise in quarterly net profit, PDD Holdings' revenue missed analyst expectations, leading to a $55bn wipeout of its market value.

##  Klarna Embraces AI-Driven Efficiency

Swedish buy now, pay later company Klarna is leveraging artificial intelligence to significantly cut its workforce. Aiming to reduce its employee count by almost half, Klarna envisions a future with as few as 2,000 employees, empowered by AI in areas like customer service and marketing.  

CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski argues that while this shift may raise concerns about employment levels, it is ultimately the responsibility of governments to address such issues. He highlights the significant boost in average annual revenue per employee from $400,000 a year ago to $700,000 now, underscoring the efficiency gains driven by AI.

##  The Race for AI Chip Supremacy

Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market is being challenged by a wave of innovative startups. Cerebras, d-Matrix, and Groq are developing specialized chips designed for running AI models more efficiently and at lower costs compared to Nvidia's GPUs.

Cerebras recently launched its new "Cerebras Inference" platform based on its CS-3 chip, claiming it to be 20 times faster than Nvidia's Hopper chips at a fraction of the price. d-Matrix is preparing for a major funding round, aiming to raise $200mn or more, and plans to launch its Corsair chip platform later this year.  

Groq secured $640mn in funding earlier this month, demonstrating investor confidence in these emerging players. This surge in activity underscores the fierce competition brewing in the AI chip market as companies race to capitalize on the booming demand for generative AI applications.

Donald Trump has been hit with an updated criminal indictment in a 2020 election case, with prosecutors filing a revised set of charges in response to a Supreme Court decision. The superseding indictment removes certain allegations and reflects the government's efforts to respect the court's holdings. Trump called the new indictment "ridiculous" and claimed it still had the same legal problems as the old one. The case is expected to be examined by a federal judge to determine what elements were "official acts" for which Trump could not be charged. **Trump's approval rating has remained unchanged despite multiple criminal indictments**.

Donald Trump has appointed Robert F Kennedy Jr, a former campaign rival, and Tulsi Gabbard, a former congresswoman from Hawaii, to his presidential transition team. Both had previously run for the Democratic nomination but endorsed Trump after Kamala Harris entered the race. **Kennedy is an anti-vaccine activist**, while Gabbard has sympathetic views of Vladimir Putin's leadership in Russia. The two are expected to play roles in preparing Trump for debates against Harris. Transition teams typically make early personnel and policy decisions for an incoming administration.

**French authorities extend custody of Telegram chief to legal limit**
Pavel Durov, Telegram's CEO, has been detained for 96 hours as part of an investigation into alleged criminal activity on the messaging app. French prosecutors have lengthened his detention twice, with the second extension being made just hours before the legal limit was reached. **Durov could be held until Wednesday night**.

The investigation includes allegations of child sexual abuse material, drug trafficking, terrorism enablement, and money laundering. The United Arab Emirates has submitted a request for consular services for Durov.

**High US childcare costs pose an election risk for Kamala Harris**

Childcare costs are a significant burden on households, especially in Nevada, a crucial swing state that could decide this year's US presidential election. Voters are feeling the pain nationally, creating another potential headwind for Kamala Harris's White House run unless she can offer a plan to bring costs down. A recent poll showed that 82% of Trump voters and 96% of Democratic voters wanted their candidate to make childcare more affordable. The cost of childcare on average is $11,582 a year, and resolving the chronic labour shortages and bureaucratic hurdles will be difficult.

Sterling hit its highest level against the dollar since March 2022, rising as much as **0.4%** to $1.3246, due to differing outlooks for interest rates in the US and UK. The Fed is expected to lower rates more quickly than the Bank of England, which has kept rates stable despite growing economic data and optimism about the new Labour government.

*UK private sector activity grew faster than expected in August*, with economic growth of **0.6%** in the second quarter also beating market expectations. However, services inflation remains above 5% and UK wage growth slowed to its lowest rate in almost two years at **5.4%**.*

Italy has stepped up its clampdown on irregular migration across the Mediterranean, impounding a humanitarian rescue ship for the 23rd time. The government accused the vessel, Geo Barents, of endangering lives and failing to provide prompt information during a night-time rescue. However, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) rejected any wrongdoing, stating that the crew intervened after seeing people falling overboard from a small boat. At least 1,027 migrants have been lost in the central Mediterranean this year, with 424 confirmed dead and 603 missing.

Seven & i Holdings, the Japanese operator of 7-Eleven, is discussing ways to defend itself against a takeover bid by Alimentation Couche-Tard, including applying for "core" status under Japan's Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (Fefta). This would subject any foreign buyer to vetting by the finance ministry. Investors argue that Couche-Tard's bid is a response to Seven & i's long-term failure to address shareholder interests. A successful takeover would be Japan's largest by a foreign buyer, with a market capitalization of over $38bn. **Efforts to apply for "core" status may not be straightforward and could face regulatory scrutiny**.

The National Football League (NFL) has approved changes allowing private equity investment in teams for the first time. This will allow owners to sell minority stakes to firms like Ares Management, Arctos Partners, and Sixth Street, which have committed to invest at least $2bn each. The total commitment is expected to reach $12bn, with a cap of 10% stake per team. This move aims to increase franchise values and provide owners with different capital sources while maintaining the league's core ethos.

**Key changes:**

* Private equity firms can now buy up to 10% stake in individual teams
* Firms must hold their stakes for at least six years and invest in no more than six teams
* Total commitment expected to reach $12bn

Ryanair expects airfares to continue falling this winter, with a predicted 5% decline in peak season fares from July to September. Chief executive Michael O'Leary stated that while he couldn't predict the rest of the financial year's fare trends, it was "reasonable to expect fares will be down 5-ish per cent through the second half of this year as well". Shares jumped close to 5% on the better-than-expected outlook. However, Boeing's delayed deliveries of new 737 Max aircraft are still causing challenges for Ryanair's growth in 2024.

Oil prices jumped on Monday, reaching almost two-week highs, due to reports that Libyan production had been shut down over political wrangling between its two governments. The shutdown, which affects about 1mn barrels a day of crude exports, was reportedly part of an escalating power struggle between the rival factions over the position of the central bank governor. **Tensions in Libya have been high since the Nato-backed uprising in 2011**, and the country's oil revenues are its only source of income.

The Warsaw stock exchange is looking to revive its fortunes after a lost decade where it failed to keep pace with Poland's booming economy. The total capitalisation of companies listed in Warsaw dropped to 22% of Polish GDP, compared to 35% in 2013. **New head Tomasz Bardziłowski** aims to attract investors and companies back to the exchange, citing recent developments such as a potential dual listing for Croatian food retailer Studenac and a planned IPO for private equity firm CVC's Polish retailer Żabka.

Klarna's board is considering removing Mikael Walther, a key ally of co-founder Victor Jacobsson, due to an eight-year investigation. The move highlights tensions at the Swedish fintech company ahead of its blockbuster listing, which could value it at $15bn-$20bn. Discussions about Walther's ousting come after another high-profile boardroom schism and raise concerns over disagreements on the composition of the board. **Klarna's leadership is facing scrutiny** as it prepares for an IPO in the UK. The company's use of special purpose vehicles to build up shares has been a point of contention among directors.

Gunvor reported a 50% fall in earnings for the first six months of 2024, as the energy market's volatility declined. Net profits came in at $417mn, which is lower compared to the same period in 2023. This decline reflects a normalization of trading conditions after unprecedented profit growth for companies in the industry. **Commodity prices have become less volatile**, with Brent crude averaging $82.93 per barrel this year and European natural gas and LNG prices down by 30-35% compared to last year's first half.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) has been criticized for its culture, with 50% of staff fearing reprisals if they speak up about misconduct. A survey found that only 14% were satisfied with the outcome after reporting issues, and many staff feel a lack of oversight and favoritism in appointments. The bank's whistleblower policy is also deemed "dysfunctional" by some employees. Despite efforts to improve conditions, former staffers question the bank's ability to turn things around unless the ombudsman is truly independent from management. **The EIB faces scrutiny over corruption and misuse of funds**, with its former president under investigation.

The Pentagon has warned of a "potential environmental catastrophe" in the Red Sea due to an oil tanker set on fire by Yemen's rebel Houthis. The Greek-flagged tanker Sounion, carrying 1mn barrels of crude, was hit last week by missiles launched by the Iran-backed Houthis. **Two tugs attempted to salvage the vessel but were warned away and threatened with attack**. A large-scale oil leak would represent the first serious environmental damage as a result of the campaign waged by the Houthis against international shipping in the Red Sea since November.

An Israeli hostage, Qaid Farhan Al-Qadi, has been rescued from Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Al-Qadi, 52, was seized during Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel and was found alone in a tunnel. He is in stable condition and has been transferred to hospital. This is the eighth hostage to be rescued alive, with around 108 remaining in Gaza. The IDF has vowed to continue pursuing the return of all hostages through all means possible. **A negotiated deal between Israel and Hamas is considered essential for the release of the remaining hostages.**

**Elite Lawyer Indicted on Charges Including Fraud and Bribery**

Luis Hermosilla, a prominent lawyer with close ties to Chile's business leaders and politicians, has been indicted on bribery, money laundering, and tax fraud charges. The investigation began after an audio recording was published of him discussing illicit payments to officials at Chile's tax authority and financial regulator. **Hermosilla is accused of bribing officials to secure favors for his clients**. The scandal risks damaging Chile's image as a haven from corruption in Latin America, with analysts warning that foreign companies may view the country as having an uneven playing field.
