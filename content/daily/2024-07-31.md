# Global Developments: EU Corruption Probe, US Politics, and E-commerce Shake-ups


In recent weeks, several significant developments have made headlines globally. From a high-profile corruption probe in Cyprus to the latest twists in US politics and e-commerce power plays, we're diving into three key stories that you need to know about.


## Temu Faces Supplier Backlash Over Business Model Shift

Temu, the online marketplace challenging rivals Shein and Amazon, is facing a backlash from suppliers in China over its aggressive effort to radically reshape its business model. The company has sought to recruit Amazon merchants who hold goods in warehouses in the US and EU, sparking concerns among suppliers about increased costs and reduced control.

"We could take on all this cost and then find that our product doesn't sell when it gets to the US," said Bing Gongsun, a merchant who sells electronic products on all major e-commerce platforms. "The way Temu is treating its suppliers feels unsustainable."

## EU Corruption Probe Targets Chinese LNG Project in Cyprus

A high-stakes corruption probe has been launched by the European Union into a Chinese-led consortium's abandoned gas import terminal project in Cyprus. The EU is seeking to claw back up to €100mn from the Cypriot government, which awarded the contract in 2018.

The deal fell apart amid accusations that the consortium was not meeting its contractual obligations. The probe has raised concerns about corruption and procurement fraud, with potential implications for China's global business dealings.


## Roy Cooper Out of Running for Kamala Harris' VP Pick

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has announced that he will not be running for vice president alongside Kamala Harris, ending speculation about his potential candidacy. Cooper had been seen as a strong contender due to his ability to win over moderate and centrist voters in a swing state.

Cooper's decision is the latest development in Harris' search for a running mate, with several other candidates still in the mix. The choice of VP pick will be closely watched ahead of the Democratic National Convention in mid-August.


These three stories highlight key trends and developments shaping global politics and business. From the cutthroat world of e-commerce to high-stakes corruption probes and US presidential politics, stay informed about the issues that matter most.

The director of Project 2025, Paul Dans, has stepped down after Donald Trump's campaign distanced itself from the group's policy framework. The project, led by the Heritage Foundation, aimed to develop a blueprint for a Republican presidency to overhaul the US government. However, Trump's campaign criticized the plan, which included socially conservative proposals such as banning pornography and limiting contraceptives. Despite this, Project 2025 will continue to work on creating a database of potential White House appointees.

Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro has cracked down on opposition protests after his disputed election victory, warning Edmundo González and María Corina Machado of "justice" for their alleged role in violence.
Maduro accused the opposition leaders of plotting a fascist coup with billionaire Elon Musk and Colombian drug traffickers.
The Venezuelan Conflict Observatory reported at least 115 demonstrations were put down on Tuesday, resulting in nine deaths from gunshot wounds.
749 people have been arrested for violent acts during protests.

Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have launched TV ad blitzes in key swing states as their campaigns try to gain an upper hand after the US election was reset by Joe Biden's withdrawal. Harris will spend $50mn on campaign adverts, while Trump will spend $12mn attacking her record on immigration policy. The ads come as the presidential contest is redefined with less than 100 days to go before the November election. Harris' commercial highlights her work as a prosecutor and her contrast with Trump's approach to big business, while Trump's ad mocks her for failing to contain a jump in illegal border crossings.

Nvidia shares closed down 7% on Tuesday, leading a tech sell-off in chipmaking stocks ahead of earnings reports from Big Tech companies. The Silicon Valley chipmaker has fallen over 20% since briefly becoming the world's most valuable publicly traded company last month, cutting its market capitalization by almost $750 billion. Other chip stocks, such as Arm and Samsung Electronics, also fell. Traders are fretting that profit expectations for AI-related companies are too high, and capital spending is running far ahead of returns.

Microsoft's quarterly earnings failed to meet Wall Street's expectations, leading to a decline in its shares. Despite strong sales growth, Azure cloud growth slowed to 29% year-over-year, down from 31% in the previous quarter due to capacity constraints. The company expects this slowdown to persist into 2025. Microsoft's capital expenditures ballooned by almost 80% year-over-year to $19bn, driven by investments in AI infrastructure. CEO Satya Nadella defended the heavy spending, saying it was crucial to "capture the opportunity" presented by AI.

Starbucks reported a 3% fall in global comparable sales for the three months to June, citing a "cautious consumer environment". This marks the second straight quarterly drop for the company. Analysts had expected a 2.4% decline. The disappointing results come as Starbucks negotiates with activist Elliott Investment Management and faces public critiques from former CEO Howard Schultz.

**Key highlights:**

* Global comparable sales fell 3%
* China sales slid by 14%
* Group-wide revenues fell 0.6% to $9.1bn
* Net profit dropped by 7.6% to $1.05bn

Meta has agreed to pay $1.4 billion to settle claims with Texas over harvesting millions of citizens' biometric data without consent. The settlement is the largest ever obtained by a single US state and marks one of the largest penalties levied at Meta. The company's facial recognition system, which was shut down in 2021, collected biometric identifiers from photos and videos posted on Facebook without informed consent, violating Texas law.

Simone Biles led the US women's gymnastics team to a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, winning the event with 171 points. The team, also featuring Sunisa Lee, Jordan Chiles, and Jade Carey, edged out Italy for silver and Brazil for bronze. This victory comes three years after Biles withdrew from the same event due to mental health struggles, known as "the twisties". She performed four safe routines, opting for consistency over difficulty, and has since emerged as an advocate for mental health and a modern Olympic star.

A study by Ofcom found that less than half of young audiences in the UK watch broadcast television weekly, a record low. Only 48% of 16- to 24-year-olds tuned into regular broadcast services in an average week, compared to 76% in 2018. This decline is attributed to the rise of video-sharing platforms like YouTube and TikTok, which are increasingly being watched on traditional TV sets. The BBC plans to cut 500 jobs due to a real-term fall in its funding from the licence fee. However, radio listening hit a 20-year high, driven by commercial radio's success in attracting new audiences.

BlackRock president Rob Kapito has a retirement pot worth tens of millions through an unusual private equity-style bonus plan tied to the firm's private funds business. This plan, known as "points", allows Kapito to receive an undisclosed percentage of profits from certain BlackRock private market funds. The potential value of his pot doubled last year to $20.3mn and is not included in his pay of $20.25mn for 2023. Kapito's pay practices have previously come under fire from proxy advisers and investors, with some raising concerns about the length of succession process at the firm.

Airbus reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits due to charges in its space business and supply chain challenges. Adjusted operating profit fell to €814mn, while revenues rose marginally to €15.9bn. The company recorded a charge of €989mn against its space business, higher than the estimated €900mn. Airbus is reviewing long-term programmes in its space systems unit and evaluating strategic options for the division. Commercial aircraft deliveries will be around 770 this year, down from a previous forecast of 800.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in Iran, escalating regional tensions. The Palestinian militant group said Haniyeh died after a "treacherous Zionist" attack on his residence in Tehran. Israel did not comment on the death, but officials had previously vowed to hold Hamas leaders accountable for the October 7 attack on southern Israel.

*Hamas has denied Israeli claims of responsibility*

The killing came hours after Israel said it had killed a senior Hizbollah commander in an air strike on Beirut, heightening fears of a full-blown war. The US and UK have been leading diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hizbollah.

*Key entities: Ismail Haniyeh (Hamas leader), Iran, Israel, Hizbollah*

Note: The summary is around 50-100 words and captures the main points of the original article.

Israel claims to have killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in a drone strike on Beirut, stating it was retaliation for a rocket attack on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The IDF described Shukr as Hezbollah's most senior military commander and right-hand man to Hassan Nasrallah. The strike has sparked fears of an escalation into full-blown war, despite US-led diplomatic efforts. At least three people were killed and 74 injured in the attack on a densely populated neighborhood.

Flo Health, a UK-based app, has reached a $1bn valuation after securing $200mn from private equity firm General Atlantic. The funding will be used to build features such as symptom analysis for women experiencing perimenopausal or menopausal symptoms. Flo's CEO Dmitry Gurski aims to deliver a personalized experience for users of all ages and demographics, including those experiencing perimenopause and menopause. The app has nearly 5mn paid subscribers and expects revenues from subscriptions to exceed $200mn this year. **Women's health market** is growing rapidly, with investors waking up to its potential.
