# Tech Trends: A Shift in Power Dynamics
The world of technology is witnessing a significant shift in power dynamics, with companies and countries vying for dominance in emerging markets. From e-commerce giants to lithium producers, the stakes are high, and the players are getting increasingly aggressive.

## JD.com's Founder Still Calling the Shots from Overseas

Richard Liu, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, is still running the show from overseas, despite stepping down as CEO. According to sources, Liu has been making key decisions on investment strategy and overseas expansion from London, where he spends most of his time.

"He is still running the company," said one source familiar with the matter. This raises questions about succession planning in Chinese tech companies, where charismatic founders often hold significant sway.

## Utilities Sector Sees a Surge in Investment

The utilities sector has seen a sudden surge in investment, thanks to the growing demand for power and the increasing importance of renewable energy sources. Companies like Microsoft and Google are pumping billions into data centers, driving up electricity consumption.

"Utilities tends to be more of a defensive sector, and right now, it is acting and behaving quite differently," said Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors.

## Lithium Producer Urges Governments to Intervene

The world's largest lithium producer, Albemarle, has urged governments to intervene in the market to loosen China's dominance. Kent Masters, CEO of Albemarle, wants more help from countries and car manufacturers to fight Chinese competition after a brutal downturn in lithium prices.

"If we're going to build western supply chains [for electric cars], then action needs to be taken now," Masters said.

These three stories highlight the changing landscape of power dynamics in the tech world. As companies and countries vie for dominance, it's clear that the stakes are high, and the players are getting increasingly aggressive.

Noah Lyles won the men's 100m final at the Paris Olympics, becoming the first American to claim the title in 20 years. He crossed the finish line in a personal best 9.784 seconds, narrowly beating Jamaican Kishane Thompson (9.789s). Fred Kerley of the US took bronze. Lyles' victory came after a long journey, including his appearance on Netflix's Sprint series. He will also contest the 200m event in Paris, where he is the favourite to win.

Private capital groups have deployed $160bn in the latest quarter, with Apollo accounting for 40% of the total. The firms are preparing for a deal revival as the US Federal Reserve edges closer to cutting interest rates. Buyout activity is up 28% so far this year to $471bn. Private equity firms have struggled to sell existing investments and return cash to their backers, but there are signs that the deal freeze is thawing. The lackluster market for pure private equity deals has led big alternative asset managers to deploy capital into credit and infrastructure instead.

US broadcaster NBC has flown in dozens of YouTubers, TikTokers, and social media influencers to create buzz around the Paris Olympic Games. These creators have a combined fan base of over 66mn on YouTube and are helping to reach a younger generation of viewers who may not have watched the Olympics before. The idea is for them to provide behind-the-scenes content and fill in storytelling gaps, as well as promote the core broadcast product. This move fits into a broader pattern of experimentation across sports, with the IOC adding urban sports like skateboarding and breakdancing to the programme.

Venezuelan opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado emerged from hiding on Saturday to attend an anti-government rally in Caracas, despite a violent crackdown by the Maduro government. Machado waved a Venezuelan flag and urged supporters to stand strong against the socialist regime. Protests have been ongoing since Monday after Maduro claimed victory in a presidential election with a 7-point margin over opposition candidate Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez. The opposition declared GonzÃ¡lez as the real winner, but their campaign offices were vandalized and Machado was feared arrested, leading her to go into hiding.

Brazil's environment minister, Marina Silva, has warned international buyers of carbon credits to be cautious due to allegedly fraudulent emissions-offset schemes in the Amazon. Police have uncovered a decade-long conspiracy involving the misappropriation of 538,000 hectares of public land and the sale of millions of dollars' worth of carbon certificates. The issue could harm the reputation of the carbon market and damage developing countries' opportunities to protect their forests and communities. A mandatory carbon system is being drafted in Brazil's congress to prevent such crimes.

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has called for an end to nationwide protests over the cost of living crisis. In a televised address, he defended his decision to remove fuel subsidies and abolish multiple foreign exchange systems, which he said was necessary to revive the economy. The president urged protesters to suspend their action to create room for dialogue. Protests have been taking place in major cities, including Abuja and Lagos, with demonstrators demanding government action to tackle economic conditions that have seen inflation reach over 34%.

Axa's chief executive, Thomas Buberl, says the proposed â‚¬5bn deal with BNP Paribas will give the company significant firepower for a string of acquisitions in the insurance sector [**Asset Management**]. The deal would allow Axa to use around â‚¬1.6bn for acquisitions, focusing on businesses in property and casualty insurance, health insurance, and Europe/Japan geographies [**Insurance Sector**] [**Geography**]. Buberl stated that every company must make its own choice, but for Axa, focusing on core operations is the right decision to create a "European champion" in asset management.

Lloyds Banking Group has hired Amazon Web Services executive Rohit Dhawan as its first group director of AI and advanced analytics. Dhawan, who has a PhD in AI from the University of Sydney, will oversee the integration of AI into customer and operational processes, create an "AI Centre of Excellence", and lead the creation of a new data and AI function within the bank. The move is part of Lloyds' digitisation efforts to improve returns and productivity gains. **[Rohit Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Dhawan)** will report to chief data and analytics officer Ranil Boteju.

Western governments are urging their citizens to leave Lebanon due to escalating tensions between Israel, Iran, and Hezbollah. The US, UK, France, Jordan, and Sweden have issued travel advisories, with some countries withdrawing families of officials and closing embassies. Commercial flights out of Lebanon are still available, but airlines have suspended or rescheduled services. The crisis follows twin assassinations in Beirut and Tehran, with Israel claiming responsibility for one and Iran vowing revenge. Diplomatic efforts are underway to avert a regional war.
