# Market Volatility Driven by Rate Cut Expectations and Gold Surge 


## A Turbulent Week in Markets: Gold Soars, PwC Faces Fallout

From regulatory pressures on financial giants to the allure of safe-haven assets and shifting monetary policy expectations, this week has been a whirlwind of economic news. We delve into three key stories that offer insights into the current market landscape. 


##  PwC Braces for Six-Month Ban in China Over Evergrande Audit

PwC China, one of the country‚Äôs largest accounting firms, is bracing for a potential six-month business ban from Chinese authorities over its role in auditing collapsed property developer Evergrande. This unprecedented move comes after regulators found that Evergrande had inflated mainland revenues by nearly $80bn in the two years preceding its default. The ban could significantly disrupt PwC's operations and lead to substantial client loss, highlighting the increasing scrutiny on audit firms in the wake of financial scandals.

"The countrywide ban would eclipse the punishment handed to rival Deloitte last year for a 'serious audit deficiencies' in its work for China Huarong Asset Management," states the article.


## Gold Hits Record Highs as Investors Bet on Rate Cuts

Gold prices surged to record highs this week, breaching $2,531 per troy ounce, fueled by investor anticipation of US interest rate cuts later this year. Institutional investors have been piling back into gold, driving up demand and pushing prices higher. This surge follows a period of relative calm in the gold market, where Chinese investors had been the primary drivers of growth.

"What we have seen is investors and speculators in the west starting to return to the gold market," explains John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council.


## Nearly $90 Billion Pours into US Money Market Funds Ahead of Expected Rate Cuts

As expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut mount, investors are flocking to money market funds seeking to lock in attractive yields. Inflows totaled nearly $90 billion in the first half of August alone, driven primarily by institutional investors positioning themselves for potential yield declines. This influx highlights the continuing appeal of these relatively safe and liquid investment vehicles even as the stock market shows signs of recovery.

"Every rate cut in recent history has been a function of lowering rates to get to zero because there's been a financial crisis," notes John Tobin, chief investment officer at Dreyfus. "Here, assuming that's not the case, we‚Äôre now talking about terminal rates with at least a 3 [per cent] handle.‚Äù

**Kamala Harris's running mate Tim Walz calls on voters to 'turn the page' on Donald Trump**

Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice-president, has attacked Donald Trump as bizarre and extreme while calling on Americans to "turn the page" on the Republican candidate and back Kamala Harris for president. **Walz delivered a keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention**, promoting Harris as a defender of freedom and patriotism, and criticizing Trump's leadership style as one that spends all day insulting people and blaming others. He also highlighted the contrast between Harris's vision for America and Trump's "weird" agenda.

Franklin Templeton's stock plummeted 12.5% after putting top bond investor Ken Leech on leave due to federal investigations into suspicious trading. Regulators warned Leech could face civil charges, and the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells notice. **The company is conducting an internal investigation** and co-operating with government probes. The stock drop reflects concerns that the probe may expand and prompt investors to pull out assets from its funds.

OpenAI has joined opposition to a California bill aiming to ensure powerful artificial intelligence is deployed safely, citing concerns that new controls would threaten its growth in the state. The company's chief strategy officer argued that legislation should come from the federal government, not individual states. The bill, SB 1047, has divided Silicon Valley, with some critics arguing it would stifle start-ups and undermine California's central position in the AI boom. **The bill aims to create a safety framework for powerful AI models**, but opponents claim it focuses on hypothetical risks and adds an "extreme" liability risk on founders.

Sephora, a subsidiary of LVMH, is cutting about 120 jobs in China as part of its efforts to streamline operations and adapt to the country's competitive beauty market. The move represents less than 3% of Sephora's workforce in China, which totals around 4,000 employees. **The job cuts are focused on headquarters roles**, with affected staff being offered severance packages, compensation, and career support services. This decision comes amid reports of soft demand for prestige products in the Chinese market, impacting companies such as L'Or√©al and Est√©e Lauder.
