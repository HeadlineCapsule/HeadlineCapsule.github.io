# The 2024 US Election: A Shift in Economic Policies and Personal Attacks

The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be a pivotal moment in American politics, with significant implications for the country's economic policies and the tone of its leadership. In this newsletter, we'll explore three recent articles that shed light on the key issues at play.

## Donald Trump's Economic Plans Would Hurt US Business

A report by the centre-left think-tank Third Way claims that Donald Trump's economic plans would have a devastating impact on US businesses. The report highlights Trump's protectionist trade proposals, threats to end the Federal Reserve's independence, and vows to crack down on immigration as major concerns. According to Gabe Horwitz, senior vice-president of Third Way's economic programme, "What he is proposing would absolutely decimate the US economy and really hurt businesses."

## Retail Sales Jump, Alleviating Fears of a Recession

In a welcome boost to the US economy, retail sales jumped 1% in July, far exceeding economists' forecasts. The strong sales data has alleviated fears of a recession, with investors responding positively to the news. According to Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, "The retail and labour market data really help support the soft landing narrative... The consumer may be cooling, but not collapsing."

## Donald Trump Rejects Allies' Calls to Tone Down Personal Attacks

Donald Trump has dismissed calls from his allies to tone down his personal attacks on Kamala Harris, insisting that he will defeat her in November's election. Trump's refusal to back down has raised concerns about the tone of the campaign and the potential impact on voters. As one observer noted, "This is not a presidential campaign; it's a reality TV show."

**Elon Musk's Megaphone Reach on X**

Elon Musk's following on X has nearly doubled since his purchase of the social media platform, giving him a public megaphone to broadcast right-leaning views and misinformation. His account has boosted smaller far-right accounts, including English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson. Independent fact-checkers have debunked at least 50 of Musk's posts this year about the US election, which collectively amassed over 1.2 billion views on the platform. X is under scrutiny for spreading misinformation that contributed to UK riots, with Musk using his account to post unfounded claims and promote far-right figures.

SLB, a US oil services company, is expanding its operations in Russia despite competitors withdrawing from the market. The company has signed new contracts and hired hundreds of staff since December 2022, despite selling their Russian businesses earlier that year. **SLB's Russian business has committed to helping build models for oil and gas deposits** with local institute Vnigni. The company continues to import materials into Russia, including equipment worth $17.5mn in 2023, with some items potentially subject to international controls.

**Norway's currency, the krone, has weakened significantly this year, making it the worst-performing among top 10 most traded currencies.**
The decline has sparked concerns among politicians and businesses, with companies forced to raise prices due to increased import costs. The central bank is also under pressure to keep borrowing costs high at a time when other rate-setters are cutting.
**A former government minister has even proposed pegging the krone to the euro, citing drastic times for the currency.**
The currency's weakness played a key role in the Norwegian central bank's recent meeting, with policymakers leaving interest rates unchanged and warning of potential further cuts if inflation doesn't come down quickly.

Revolut, a London-headquartered fintech company, is being courted by the UK government as it considers a potential initial public offering (IPO). Despite receiving a critical UK banking licence, the company still favors listing on the Nasdaq market in the US over London. City minister Tulip Siddiq is expected to meet Revolut executives to discuss their plans and the Treasury's efforts to emphasize London's appeal. A move to float in the US would be a blow to London, which has seen several companies relist there in recent years. **Revolut's valuation is estimated at $45bn**, making it one of the UK's most valuable banks if it lists.

**SoftBank's AI Chip Plans**

SoftBank discussed a tie-up with Intel to produce an AI chip, but talks failed due to Intel's inability to meet SoftBank's volume and speed demands. SoftBank is now focusing on discussions with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) to manufacture its AI chips. The plan aims to create a rival to Nvidia's market-leading AI chips by combining Arm's chip designs with Graphcore's production expertise. **SoftBank's CEO, Masayoshi Son**, plans to invest billions of dollars in the venture, which could be funded by advance orders from Big Tech companies like Google and Meta.

Psychedelic medicine pioneer Rick Doblin has left the board of Lykos Therapeutics after a major setback for the company's bid to approve party drug ecstasy as a mental health treatment. The US FDA rejected Lykos' application, citing concerns over patchy data and trial design. Despite this, Lykos plans to move forward with clinical development and regulatory affairs. **Doblin will remain involved with non-profit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (Maps)**, which is Lykos's biggest shareholder. The company aims to secure approval for the first new PTSD treatment in over two decades.

The US is easing restrictions on sharing sensitive technology with the UK and Australia, removing barriers to trilateral defense cooperation as part of the Aukus security pact. The US Department of State is amending its International Traffic in Arms Regulation rules to facilitate military-related technology sharing with allies. This change will allow the UK and Australia to access American technology for around 80% of their defense-related trade without needing licenses, boosting collaboration on areas like nuclear-powered submarines and undersea military capabilities. **The US hopes this will help counter China in the Indo-Pacific**.

**Venezuela Crisis**

Brazil and Colombia have called for fresh presidential elections in Venezuela, amid a crisis sparked by Nicolás Maduro's disputed re-election. The opposition claims its candidate, Edmundo González, won the election with over 2:1 margin, but Maduro's allies control the National Electoral Council and have not published detailed results. US President Joe Biden has also supported new elections, while Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado rejected the proposal, saying "if [Maduro] doesn't like the results do we go for a third one?"

A UK property developer, Revelan, is suing PwC for £6.6mn, alleging that the Big Four accountancy firm provided "negligent" tax advice that led to a £3mn bill to Britain's tax authority. The errors occurred over a five-year period and resulted from PwC's failure to accurately calculate tax due, according to court documents. **PwC admitted making errors** in a letter to HM Revenue & Customs, citing the complexity of Revelan's tax affairs as the reason for the mistakes. The case marks the latest lawsuit against a Big Four consulting firm regarding tax advisory work.

**Margrethe Vestager's tenure as EU antitrust chief is ending**
The Danish government will not nominate her for a third term, citing her party's poor performance in the 2022 elections.
Vestager has been a fierce enforcer of the bloc's antitrust rules, hitting big tech companies with multibillion-euro fines. However, her star began to fade amid mounting legal challenges and opposition from France.
She will be succeeded by an unknown candidate, which could exacerbate the gender imbalance in the new commission.
The EU Commission is expected to take office later this autumn, but the outcome of Vestager's market abuse cases remains uncertain.

**Joe Biden's administration has struck a deal with Big Pharma to cap prices on 10 expensive medicines, saving Americans $7.5 billion in drug costs in the first year. The program, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, will reduce net spending for Medicare by 22% and out-of-pocket costs for patients by $1.5 billion. Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged to "take on Big Pharma" and continue Biden's efforts to cut prescription drug costs if elected. The deal targets cancer, heart disease, and diabetes medications produced by 11 different drugmakers, with negotiated discounts ranging from 38% to 79%.**

**Hedge funds Citadel and DE Shaw slashed their holdings in Nvidia ahead of this month's stock market rout, while Renaissance and Marshall Wace added to their positions.**
Citadel ditched about 500,000 shares in the second quarter, taking its holding to $19mn at the end of June, down from $60mn at the end of March.
**Renaissance picked up 1.5mn shares**, building its position to 7mn shares, worth $867mn, by the end of June. Marshall Wace bought around 3.7mn shares to value its holding at $1.5bn.
**The Financial Times analysed SEC filings from 23 big hedge funds**, showing that on average they sold off about 6% of their holdings in Nvidia.

Macau, the world's largest gambling hub, is cracking down on unlicensed currency traders that help gamblers skirt China's strict capital controls. The crackdown has raised fears of a fresh regulatory clampdown that could hurt the territory's mega casinos. **Up to five years in prison and a 10-year ban from gambling sites** will be imposed on those caught providing unauthorized currency-changing services within casino premises or associated facilities. This move has dented the shares of Macau's six casino operators, with a 7% fall in the past month.

Food supplies into Gaza have dwindled, with the World Food Programme (WFP) able to bring in only about half of the required quantity, according to regional director Corinne Fleischer. **Famine looms** as a result, with 96% of Gaza's population facing acute food insecurity. Access problems include the closure of most crossings, long delays at Israeli checkpoints, and looting by gangs inside Gaza. The WFP needs more crossing points and faster processing of aid to address these issues. **500,000 people are enduring catastrophic conditions**, with diseases expected to spread due to collapsing basic services.
