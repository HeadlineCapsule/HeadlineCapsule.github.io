# Big Tech Faces Antitrust Scrutiny and AI Investment Boom 


## Big Tech Under Fire: Competition Concerns Heat Up

The world's largest tech companies are facing mounting scrutiny from regulators and competitors alike. This week saw a wave of news highlighting ongoing antitrust battles, investment surges into AI infrastructure, and the growing pains of managing powerful new technologies.  Let's dive in.

## Google Wins Appeal Against €1.5bn EU Fine

In a significant legal victory for Google, the EU's General Court overturned a €1.5bn fine levied against the tech giant for allegedly abusing its dominance in online advertising. While the court acknowledged some of the European Commission's findings regarding Google's anti-competitive practices, it ultimately ruled that the commission failed to consider all relevant factors when assessing the duration of the disputed contractual clauses. This decision represents a setback for Brussels, which has been aggressively pursuing antitrust cases against Big Tech.

"This case is about a very narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishers’ websites," Google stated in response. "We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the commission’s decision. We are pleased that the court has recognised errors in the original decision and annulled the fine."

## Meta Faces Hefty EU Fine Over Classified Ads Practices

Meta (formerly Facebook) is bracing for a potential hefty fine from the EU over its alleged attempts to dominate the classified advertising market. The commission is expected to argue that Facebook's Marketplace service unfairly leverages its platform's vast user base and data access to undermine rival classified ad businesses. If found guilty, Meta could face penalties of up to 10% of its global annual revenue, though regulators typically impose much lower sanctions.

"The claims made by the European Commission are without foundation," Meta stated in response. "We continue to work with regulatory authorities to demonstrate that our product innovation is pro-consumer and pro-competitive."

Meta maintains that Facebook Marketplace operates within a highly competitive landscape and does not use data from rivals to compete against them. The commission's decision is expected as early as next month.

## BlackRock and Microsoft Plan $30bn Fund for AI Infrastructure

In a bid to address the immense energy demands of rapidly developing AI technologies, BlackRock and Microsoft are partnering to launch a more than $30bn investment fund focused on building data centers and renewable energy projects. This ambitious effort, dubbed the Global AI Investment Partnership, aims to leverage up to an additional $70bn in debt financing. 

"Mobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centres and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated.


The fund comes at a crucial time as the exponential growth of generative AI and cloud computing places immense strain on existing energy grids. The International Energy Agency estimates that global electricity consumption by data centers could surpass 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, more than twice the amount used in 2022.

This collaboration underscores the critical role of infrastructure investments in supporting the next wave of technological innovation.

The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, leaving the federal funds rate at 4.75% to 5%. This is the first cut in more than four years and signals an era of easing. Fed chair Jay Powell said the decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is under control and the labor market can be maintained with moderate growth. The move is seen as a pre-emptive strike against any weakening of the US economy and labor market after more than a year of holding rates at their highest level since 2001. **The Fed expects to cut rates further, with most officials forecasting another large reduction by the end of 2024.**

Kamala Harris acknowledged that she needs to earn the support of Black male voters, who are turning away from her and towards Donald Trump. She emphasized that she doesn't assume their vote based on her own identity, but is "working to earn [their] vote". Harris also criticized Trump's racist rhetoric, calling it "exhausting" and "hateful", and highlighted her economic policies, including capping childcare costs at 7% of income. A recent poll showed that 1 in 4 Black men plan to back Trump in November, with concerns about Harris' ability to win their support in key battleground states.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has decided not to endorse a candidate in November's US presidential election, surprising some with their decision. The union, which includes UPS drivers, railroad workers, and nurses, reported that 58% of its members wanted it to endorse Donald Trump, almost twice the number favoring Kamala Harris. **The union's leadership said neither major candidate made serious commitments to their interests**. This is the first time the Teamsters have not made an endorsement in 28 years, with implications for the presidential election.

**Donald Trump criticizes Fed's interest rate cut, saying it shows the US economy is "very bad"**. The Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point was seen as a significant move, but Trump accused the central bank of playing politics. He also questioned whether the economy would be doing poorly or if the Fed was making a political statement. **The cut comes amid concerns about inflation and high prices**, which are major sources of financial stress for many voters, according to opinion polls.

JPMorgan Chase has appointed Ryland McClendon as the global investment banking associate and analyst leader, a move aimed at addressing concerns about working conditions for young employees on Wall Street. The appointment comes after renewed scrutiny following the death of a junior banker at Bank of America who was a US special forces veteran. JPMorgan has capped junior bankers' working week at 80 hours, but the limit does not apply when employees are working on live deals. **McClendon will oversee the wellbeing and success** of entry-level positions, aiming to improve their working environment.

The US and Japan are close to a deal to curb tech exports to China's chip industry despite concerns about Chinese retaliation. The White House wants to unveil new export controls before the presidential election, including measures forcing non-US companies to get licenses to sell products to China that would help its tech sector. Japan is worried about Chinese threats to retaliate against Japanese companies, particularly by restricting critical mineral exports.

**US and Japan want to establish complementary export control regimes**, with the US seeking to restrict servicing, software updates, and maintenance of chipmaking tools for Chinese groups like Huawei. **China has threatened retaliation**, including blocking exports of gallium and graphite, if Tokyo adopts the export controls. The negotiations have centered on aligning the three countries' export control rules to avoid targeting Japanese and Dutch companies.

Asda's billionaire co-owner Mohsin Issa is stepping down from running the UK's third-largest supermarket chain, citing that his work at Asda is complete. Lord Stuart Rose and Rob Hattrell will take over day-to-day responsibility for leading the supermarket. This comes as Asda continues to lose market share to rivals, with a 12.6% share of the grocery market in the 12 weeks to September 1. Mohsin Issa will focus on running EG Group, which he founded with his brother Zuber.

Rolls-Royce has been selected as the preferred supplier by the Czech government to build a fleet of mini nuclear reactors. The UK aerospace and defence group beat six other rivals, including GE-Hitachi and Westinghouse Electric, to secure the deal with state utility ČEZ Group. **The first reactor is planned for the mid-2030s near the South Bohemian Temelín nuclear power plant**. This "landmark" partnership aims to strengthen Rolls-Royce's position in Europe's small-modular reactor market and generate billions of pounds worth of export orders for UK industry.

Al Gore warns that the US presidential election outcome will determine the pace of climate action, calling it a "Manichaean choice". The contrast between candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's policy positions on climate change is clear, with one believing the crisis is real and the other spreading falsehoods. Gore notes that the shift to a cleaner economy is unstoppable but its pace depends on who becomes the next president. He also expresses concerns about rising tensions in geopolitics, particularly between China and the West, which could impact the transition to renewable energy.

India has surpassed China's weighting in the MSCI All-Country World index, a key stock market benchmark. This shift reflects India's strong economic growth and investor demand for its stocks. The country's blue-chip Nifty 50 index has hit record highs this year, with over $38bn of domestic money flowing into Indian equities. **India now holds a 2.33% weighting in the MSCI All-Country World index**, while China's weighting has dropped to 2.06%. This change is seen as a natural evolution of the market, driven by India's improving liquidity and Chinese stocks' depressed valuations.

The EU's incoming competition chief, Teresa Ribera, has signaled a new era in merger rules to help European companies build scale and compete with global rivals. She plans to take a step-by-step approach to reforms, clearing barriers to innovation and boosting competitiveness against the US and China. Ribera aims to incentivize industrial ecosystems around products like car manufacturing, and may revise merger rules to favor European champions. Her predecessor warned that wholesale reform could create uncertainty, but Ribera is open to adapting to changing circumstances.

Taiwan's defence minister, Wellington Koo, has warned that China's growing military activity will make it harder to spot signs of an attack on Taiwan. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has increased patrols and drills near Taiwan to unprecedented levels since President Lai Ching-te took office. The PLA has conducted its largest amphibious landing drills opposite Taiwan and is deploying non-military government ships in waters around Taiwan. Koo emphasized the need for Taiwan's armed forces to test their response to potential contingencies and differentiate between peacetime and wartime activities. **Taiwan's defence spending will increase by 7.7% next year, but its reaction time to an emergency "cannot be as long as we would have imagined in the past"**.

The US government has extended its review of Nippon Steel's proposed $15bn acquisition of US Steel, citing national security concerns. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (Cfius) had already completed a review and concluded that the deal posed risks that could not be mitigated. **President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris have expressed opposition to the deal**, which is also opposed by the United Steelworkers Union. The extension means the final decision will likely fall to the next president, with the US election scheduled for November 5.

The US dollar is trading near one-year lows due to weakening US data and expectations of a 0.5 percentage point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This has led to bets that the Fed will loosen monetary policy, putting downward pressure on the dollar. The greenback's decline contrasts with rising US stocks, highlighting division among investors about the outlook for the world's biggest economy. Strategists note that the dollar is ignoring recent declines in China and Europe, where foreign investors are favoring better-performing US stocks and traditional safe havens. **The dollar may soon flip to a move higher**, according to some strategists, as global growth differentials have narrowed and the US economy remains relatively strong.

London's cocoa market is facing a crisis due to a backlog of old, poor-quality beans lying in warehouses. **Cocoa prices have diverged between the UK and US markets**, with New York prices rising strongly while London prices fell. The global shortage has led to a race among cocoa bean processors to secure high-grade beans, leaving older varieties behind. **London's market is particularly affected** by stocks of harvested beans emptying out, with warehouses holding only 15-year-low inventories.

Microsoft is seeking **"clarity and consistency"** from the US government on export controls for AI chips, which have been held up due to concerns over potential transfer to China. Despite these delays, Microsoft and its partner G42 announced the co-founding of two new research institutes in Abu Dhabi, focused on building AI systems for developing countries. The companies aim to show responsible use of AI and make technology available beyond Western markets. **Microsoft has invested $1.5bn** in G42 to access emerging markets in Africa and Asia, where demand for AI is growing.

Dutch bank ING plans to cut ties with clients that don't make sufficient progress on reducing their climate impact. **ING's CEO Steven van Rijswijk** said the bank will restrict or stop finance for companies failing to address their carbon footprint. The move is in contrast to many US banks, which have loosened climate targets or become reluctant to speak out about global warming risks. ING assessed 2,000 clients and set a deadline of 2026 for progress. The bank aims to align with the Paris Agreement and help clients do the same.

The Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Germany is facing a tough election in Brandenburg, an eastern state where they have held power uninterrupted since reunification. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is expected to win, which would be a blow to SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government. The SPD has launched a personalized campaign, with Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke threatening to resign if the AfD wins. Despite this, current polls suggest the AfD will still come first, making it difficult for Woidke to form a workable government.

Hero MotoCorp, India's largest motorcycle and scooter producer, plans to launch electric scooters in the UK and Europe next year. This will be its first foray into a developed market. The company may also export bigger vehicles with conventional petrol engines to the UK and other European markets. Hero aims to sell e-scooters under its Vida electric brand, with a planned UK launch in mid-2025. To build a profitable business, analysts say Hero needs to offer more expensive motorcycles, such as its Mavrick model, which is yet to taste success in developed markets.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reduced the "tick size" for stock market trades from a penny to half a penny, cutting trading costs for investors. The changes also slash access fees by two-thirds, potentially hurting brokers but offsetting some of that hit. The rules aim to level the playing field between exchanges and lightly-regulated dark pools. Despite initial plans being softened, the SEC still faces court challenges on related rules. The new rules are designed to promote transparency, competition, fairness, and efficiency in the $5tn equity markets.

The Federal Reserve's rate cut left little changed in stock and bond markets. Despite a larger-than-normal cut, major stock benchmarks and government bonds ended the day barely changed. Investors had expected wild market moves but took the decision in stride. **A 50 basis point reduction was widely anticipated** as the Fed tries to balance its mandate to control inflation and protect the labor market. The S&P 500 closed 0.3% lower, with some analysts attributing the slight decline to profit-taking ahead of a seasonally weak period.

**Virtus and BondBloxx have joined State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) in launching actively managed private credit exchange traded funds (ETFs).**

* Both Virtus and BondBloxx filed for funds focused on investing in credit collateralized loan obligations composed mostly of loans to private companies, with BondBloxx filing first.
* SSGA previously floated a prospectus for a private credit fund operated jointly with Apollo Global Management.
* The filings reflect intensifying industry competition to develop '40 Act products packaging private market access.
* **Retail investors are expected to allocate $5.1tn to private markets by 2025, creating a significant windfall opportunity.**

In Lebanon, **Hizbollah walkie-talkies exploded** on Wednesday, killing at least 20 people and injuring 450, a day after thousands of pagers detonated in the country. The blasts are believed to be linked to Israel, with Hizbollah vowing revenge. The attacks have raised fears of a broader conflict between Israel and Lebanon. **Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant signalled that Israel is entering a new phase of fighting on its northern border**.

**Instagram has announced that it will make teenagers' profiles private by default, addressing concerns over social media's impact on young people.** 
**Teenagers' accounts will be visible only to their followers unless they or their parents change privacy settings.**
**Users aged 16 or over can change settings themselves, while under-16s need parental supervision.**
**The new features aim to protect minors from harmful content and predators, and Meta plans to introduce them globally on Instagram this year and across other apps next year.**
