# Tech Giants Face Scrutiny Over App Store Policies and AI Investments
The tech industry is under fire as regulators and developers push back against restrictive app store policies and investments in artificial intelligence.

## Apple's Latest Concession on App Store Rules
Apple has announced further changes to its App Store rules in an attempt to avoid billions of euros in potential fines under the EU's Digital Markets Act. The move marks the fourth time the company has made concessions since first moving to comply with the bloc's regulations earlier this year. The new rules will allow developers to direct users to make purchases outside the App Store, potentially reducing Apple's revenue.

## US Labour Market Shows Signs of Resilience
Despite recent recession fears, the US labour market is showing signs of resilience. New data shows that initial state unemployment claims have fallen to their lowest level in a month, with 233,000 applications filed in the week ending August 3. This positive surprise has helped calm markets and reduced expectations of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

## UK Regulator Launches Probe into Amazon's $4bn Anthropic Deal
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a formal merger inquiry into Amazon's $4 billion investment in artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic. The move comes as regulators worldwide increase their scrutiny of Big Tech's investments in AI companies, citing concerns over anti-competitive behaviour and the concentration of market power.

**Ukraine's counter-offensive in Russia's Kursk region continues with Ukrainian forces fighting to expand and solidify their presence on the third day of Kyiv's most audacious counteroffensive of the war.**

*The Russian defence ministry claimed that roughly 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers had taken part in the operation and that Kyiv had lost 600 military personnel and 82 armoured vehicles â€” figures that could not be independently verified.*
**Ukrainian forces have captured 11 settlements, including Nikolaevo-Darino, Darino, and Sverdlikovo, and are operating within Lyubimovka.**
*The area amounts to about 350 square kilometres.*
**Kyiv's objectives remain opaque, although one appears to be to force Russia to divert troops from its own offensive in eastern Ukraine.**

Barclays has become the first UK bank to scrap the EU bonus cap, following the UK's post-Brexit decision to remove the limits last year. The bank will use a model employed by JPMorgan, setting bonuses for senior staff at up to **10 times** their fixed pay, while keeping base pay the same. This change will affect around 1,600 material risk takers, including bankers outside the UK. Most US and British banks operating in the UK are expected to follow suit, altering competition dynamics for hiring top bankers in London.

**Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont evades arrest in Spain**

Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan president, returned to Spain for the first time in nearly seven years but avoided arrest on Thursday. Police had set up roadblocks and launched a manhunt, but Puigdemont vanished after addressing supporters in Barcelona. He is wanted on charges of misuse of public funds related to a failed push for Catalan independence in 2017. The incident is likely to roil national politics and re-energise parts of the Catalan independence movement loyal to him. **Puigdemont's arrest could also threaten the stability of Spain's Socialist-led government**.

Donald Trump has vowed to fill up the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) if he becomes president, citing the need for energy independence and reducing reliance on foreign oil. The SPR is at its lowest level since 1983, with just over half its capacity of 750 million barrels. Filling it back up would require buying nearly 300 million barrels of crude oil, which would need Congressional approval. This move could boost oil demand by hundreds of millions of barrels and has been criticized as using the SPR for short-term election-year gains rather than long-term strategic purposes. **The price of Brent crude was up 2.1% on Wednesday following Trump's comments**.

Coutts' head of asset management, Mohammad Kamal Syed, has resigned after more than 12 years with the bank. His departure comes after new CEO Emma Crystal started in July and follows a scandal last year involving politician Nigel Farage being "debanked" for his political views. **Syed was interim chief executive until June** and was on the board of Coutts during the controversy. The bank is shifting its investment strategy to focus more on international equities, particularly US tech companies.

Two major US television companies, Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), have written down the value of their cable channels by $15 billion. This move highlights the decline of traditional cable TV, which was once a lucrative business for media companies. The writedowns were triggered by a decline in linear TV viewership, with 2.4 million US pay-TV subscribers cutting the cord in the first three months of this year. **Paramount and WBD are struggling to cope with the shift to streaming services**, with their cable channels becoming "anchors around the necks of legacy media companies".

Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have kicked off their welcome tour, taking to stages at rallies across battleground states. They pitched themselves as defenders of personal freedoms, including abortion rights and safety from gun violence. Harris is trying to win back Latino voters, who have waned in support for Democrats. The Democratic ticket is united and looking up, with crowds cheering and polls trending well. However, their enthusiasm was disrupted by a small group of protesters upset with US policies on Israel and Gaza in Detroit.

Mexico's central bank, Banxico, cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 10.75% due to downside risks to growth during global volatility. The economy is expected to slow down, with analysts forecasting just 1.8% growth this year and 1.6% in 2025. The peso strengthened against the dollar following the decision. The bank's board warned of weak economic activity, a strong currency, and uncertainty around the US election weighing on sentiment. **Inflation forecast was raised to 4.4% for the fourth quarter**.

**California wildfires have destroyed thousands of acres of trees enrolled in the state's carbon offset programme, which allows forest owners to sell credits for preserving trees to other businesses to offset their pollution.** The blaze, known as the Park Fire, has burnt through 45,000 acres of trees, while other fires earlier this year affected more than 29,000 acres of forest in Washington and New Mexico. **Buyers of these credits include Chevron, Shell, and BP**, which did not immediately comment on the situation.

Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, expects reinsurance prices to remain high due to benign market conditions and increased costs for businesses and households. The company reported a record â‚¬3.8bn of post-tax profits in the first half, driven by a steep increase in the cost of insuring against natural catastrophes. **Reinsurers are not expecting any "softening" in the market ahead of key policy renewals**, with Munich Re's CEO stating that the market environment will remain highly attractive. Other companies, such as Beazley and Lancashire, have also reported record profits.

**Israel's Far-Right Minister Condemned by Allies**

Israel's European allies have condemned finance minister Bezalel Smotrich for suggesting that starving 2mn Gazans might be justified to force Hamas to release hostages. Germany and France called his comments "appalling" and "disgraceful", while the EU described them as "beyond ignominious". The UK's foreign secretary said deliberate starvation of civilians is a war crime, with no justification for Smotrich's remarks.

Israel also revoked diplomatic status of 8 Norwegians working in the West Bank as punishment for Oslo recognising Palestine as a state. This move was called an "extreme action" by Norway's foreign minister. The comments and actions come amid ongoing tensions between Israel and its allies over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Mozambique's former finance minister, Manuel Chang, has been convicted of accepting $7mn in bribes as part of a massive international fraud scheme known as the "tuna bonds" scandal. Chang, who served as finance minister from 2004 to 2015, was found guilty of conspiracies to commit wire fraud and money laundering over his role in approving bogus investments that ultimately collapsed and wrecked the country's economy. **He faces up to 20 years in prison**. The conviction is the latest in a series of legal repercussions from the scandal, which was one of Africa's largest corruption cases.

**Entain Upgrades Forecasts After Euro Boost**
Betting group Entain has upgraded its full-year revenue forecast, citing a boost from the Euro 2024 football tournament and delays to tougher gambling rules in several markets. The company expects group core profit to range between Â£1.04bn to Â£1.09bn, driven by online sports betting and gaming sales. Shares in Entain were up over 7% by mid-afternoon in London. **The upgrade is a positive update for the business, which has struggled with investor discontent and compliance issues in the past year**.
