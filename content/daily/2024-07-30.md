**Supreme Court Under Fire: Biden Proposes Reforms Amid Growing Unrest**

The US Supreme Court has long been a contentious institution, but recent years have seen it come under fire like never before. With its conservative majority handing down a string of divisive rulings, many are calling for reforms to restore balance and credibility to the nation's highest court. This week, President Biden joined the chorus, proposing a series of changes aimed at improving transparency and accountability.

### A Call for Transparency: Binding Code of Conduct Proposed

In a move that could have significant implications for the Supreme Court, President Biden has called for a binding code of conduct to be implemented for justices. Currently, the court's ethics code is voluntary and weak, leaving many to question the impartiality of certain justices. "It's telling that we need to do this," said one administration official, "but it's clear that the current system isn't working." The proposed changes would require justices to disclose more information about their finances and potential conflicts of interest.

### Expansion of the Court? Biden Stays Neutral

While some have called for the Supreme Court to be expanded in order to offset its conservative majority, President Biden has thus far stayed neutral on the issue. However, his recent proposals do suggest that he is open to exploring ways to improve the court's diversity and representation. "We need a Supreme Court that looks like America," said one Democratic senator, who supports expansion efforts.

### A Rebuke to Trump: Constitutional Amendment Proposed

In a move seen as a direct rebuke to former President Donald Trump, President Biden has proposed a constitutional amendment that would deny presidents immunity from prosecution for crimes committed while in office. The proposal comes after the Supreme Court recently ruled that Trump could be afforded some immunity for official acts, potentially affecting ongoing cases against him. "No one is above the law," said Biden, who has long advocated for greater accountability in government.

Hungary has eased visa restrictions for Russian visitors, allowing them to travel through much of the EU unhindered. This move has raised "serious national security concerns" according to Manfred Weber, chair of the European People's party. Weber warns that this policy could create loopholes for espionage activities and make it easier for Russians to move around the Schengen area. The EPP is calling on EU leaders to take urgent countermeasures to protect the integrity of the Schengen area.

**Important Keywords:**
* Hungary
* Russia
* Visa restrictions
* National security concerns
* European People's party

Italian beachgoers may face disruptions in August as sunbed businesses plan a 2-4 hour closure on several days to protest the government's decision to revoke lucrative concessions.

This comes after pressure from Brussels to reallocate beach management concessions through competitive bidding. The European Commission launched infringement procedures against Italy in 2020, and municipalities are preparing fresh tenders with compensation policies. **Italian Union of Beach Entrepreneurs** and other business associations are seeking fairness and moral acceptance for their businesses.

Donald Trump has made a strong pitch to bitcoin enthusiasts, promising to make America "the bitcoin superpower of the world" if elected president. This shift in stance has won him support from an industry that feels persecuted by the Biden administration's regulatory scrutiny. Trump's speech at the annual bitcoin conference was met with enthusiasm, and his campaign has accepted over $25mn in crypto donations. His vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, also owns Bitcoin, further solidifying the campaign's pro-crypto stance.

Amazon Prime Video has undercut rival Netflix on advertising prices, joining a crowded field of ad-funded streaming services. The platform, which automatically converted 200mn subscribers to the ad tier unless they opted out, offers brands targeted audiences and "shoppable" ad formats. This move has increased competition for advertisers and forced rivals to reduce their pricing. Analysts expect Apple to introduce ads on its streaming service soon, while Amazon's advertising revenue is expected to grow with the addition of Prime Video adverts.

The UK's accounting regulator, Financial Reporting Council (FRC), has criticized BDO and Forvis Mazars for shortcomings in their audits for the fourth straight year. The FRC said the gap between the Big Four and mid-tier firms had widened, with BDO and Forvis Mazars' performance falling "significantly below our expectations". The regulator threatened to take stronger action if improvements are not seen in 2025, including banning them from auditing listed companies. This underlines the challenge mid-tier accounting firms face as they try to wrestle market share from the dominant Big Four.

Ethiopia has floated its currency, a move expected to ease chronic foreign currency shortages and attract foreign investment.
