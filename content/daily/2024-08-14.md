Big Tech's AI Talent Raids
========================

The recent string of talent raids by Big Tech companies on AI start-ups has significant implications for the industry. We've curated three articles that provide insight into this trend and its potential impact on venture capitalists, investors, and the broader tech landscape.

## The Rise of AI Talent Raids

Big Tech companies are increasingly poaching top talent from AI start-ups, leaving venture capitalists with limited returns on their investments. A recent example is Google's hiring of Character.Ai's co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, as well as licensing the start-up's celebrity-impersonating chatbots.

## Investors Flock to Bonds Amid Recession Fears

As recession fears intensify, investors are turning to bonds as a safe-haven asset. The appeal of bonds is evident in the recent rally in US Treasuries and other highly rated debt, which has pulled yields to their lowest level in over a year. According to Robert Tipp, head of global bonds at PGIM Fixed Income, "The best protection against a downside scenario like a recession is Treasury bonds."

## The Impact on Venture Capital

The trend of Big Tech companies hiring talent from AI start-ups raises concerns about the returns on investment for venture capitalists. As Mike Volpi, a partner at Index Ventures, notes, "VCs, especially those with larger funds, need outsized outcomes to cover their bad bets." This highlights the challenges faced by venture capitalists in generating significant returns in a market dominated by Big Tech companies.

Connecting Threads
------------------

The three articles highlight the increasing competition for talent in the AI industry, with Big Tech companies willing to pay top dollar to attract and retain the best minds. This trend has significant implications for venture capitalists, who must adapt their investment strategies to remain competitive. As the tech landscape continues to evolve, it's essential to stay informed about the latest trends and developments shaping the industry.

**Ukrainian forces seek to hold Russian positions after capturing hundreds of troops**

Ukrainian forces have solidified their gains in newly seized Russian territory, capturing hundreds of Russian soldiers as Kyiv's brazen incursion entered its second week. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the Ukrainian units that replenished the exchange fund for prisoners of war. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have hit Ukrainian forces with air strikes and artillery fire, but the claims could not be independently verified. Ukraine's commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky stated that Ukrainian troops had advanced up to 3km in different directions in Kursk region, taking another 40 sq km and holding 74 settlements.

Starbucks has ousted CEO Laxman Narasimhan, replacing him with Chipotle's Brian Niccol. **The decision was made after activist investor Elliott Management and former boss Howard Schultz criticized the company's strategy**. Narasimhan oversaw Starbucks' first decline in comparable sales since 2020, while Niccol has overseen significant growth at Chipotle. **Niccol will take over on September 9**, with Mellody Hobson becoming lead independent director. The move is seen as a transformational step forward by Elliott Management, which had been holding talks with the company over demands including board representation.

Investor confidence in the Eurozone has plummeted, with the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment falling 25.8 points to 17.9 in August. **This is the biggest drop since April 2020**. Germany's economic sentiment suffered its worst fall in two years, with a 22.6-point decline to 19.2. The ECB may cut interest rates next month, with analysts citing weak investor morale and disappointing US business data as reasons for further action. German bonds edged up higher after the survey was published.

The Turkish government suspended access to Instagram due to alleged censorship of pro-Hamas content, but restored it after negotiations with Meta leadership. This incident highlights the limits of global content governance and the differing interpretations of Hamas as a terrorist entity or liberation movement. Western countries view it as a terrorist organization, while some nations in the global south see it as a liberation movement. The platform's policies are shaped by a western worldview, leading to tensions with non-western governments. **Establishing international regulations for online content** is challenging due to varying political norms, so platforms should instead increase transparency, accountability, and diversity of viewpoints in their policies.

AstraZeneca has reached a Â£200bn valuation, making it the only current UK-listed company to achieve this milestone. The company's shares rose 1.1% on Tuesday to reach this market capitalization, with its stock increasing by almost 20% this year. This growth comes under CEO Pascal Soriot's leadership, who has focused on research and development since a failed takeover attempt by Pfizer in 2014. AstraZeneca's pipeline of advanced oncology drugs holds promise for future earnings, with analysts citing Enhertu as one of the company's most promising treatments.

The mayor of Johannesburg, Kabelo Gwamanda, has resigned after 15 months in charge due to increasing anger from residents over years of political gridlock and collapsed public services. The city has had eight mayors since 2019, with water shortages, a crumbling road network, and unpaid bills to the state power utility Eskom being major issues. Gwamanda's exit was welcomed by civil society groups, who said he had been "a mayor missing in action." A new mayor, Dada Morero, has been nominated, but some critics say the city still needs significant improvement.

Cargill, the world's largest crop trader, reported a decline in annual revenues to $160bn from a record $177bn due to ample crop supplies depressing prices. The company is restructuring its operations under new leadership and has streamlined its business units into three divisions: food enterprise; agriculture and trading; and specialised portfolio. Cargill's profit targets were not met in the 2024 fiscal year, amid pressure in the beef sector due to drought in the US. **The company expects a transformational strategy will drive long-term profitable growth**.

Bellway, a UK housebuilder, has withdrawn its takeover bid for Crest Nicholson due to "not being able to fully conclude due diligence". This decision led to a 20% drop in Crest Nicholson's shares on Tuesday. Bellway had previously offered Â£720mn for the equity of Crest Nicholson but decided not to make a firm offer after an extended deadline was set by the UK's Takeover Panel. The collapse of the deal creates challenges for Crest Nicholson's new CEO, Martyn Clark, who must turn around the struggling FTSE 250 business.

US President Joe Biden expects Iran to refrain from retaliatory strikes on Israel if a ceasefire is reached in Gaza and Israeli hostages are released. The US has sent warships and fighter jets to the Middle East, while diplomats have intensified efforts to prevent Iranian retaliation. A deal is being mediated by the US, Egypt, and Qatar to end the 10-month conflict in Gaza, where thousands of Palestinians have been killed or displaced. **Biden administration officials say an attack from Iran on Israel does not appear imminent**.

**Brussels Slaps Down Thierry Breton Over 'Harmful Content' Letter to Elon Musk**

The European Commission has accused its internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, of going rogue by sending a letter to Elon Musk threatening punishment if content on social media site X was found to place EU citizens at risk of "serious harm". The commission denied Breton had approval for the letter and said it would investigate X's handling of disinformation. Breton's letter cited concerns about the spread of false information on X, which has been accused of fuelling far-right sentiment in Europe.

**Hipgnosis Sues Barry Manilow Over Bonus Payments**

Hipgnosis Songs Fund is suing Barry Manilow over bonus payments tied to the purchase of his back catalogue. The dispute is over a sum in the low single-digit millions. Hipgnosis acquired the rights to 917 songs by Manilow in 2020, including hits like **Copacabana (At the Copa) and Mandy**. The lawsuit claims a breach of contract, with Hipgnosis stating there was a difference in understanding of certain clauses in the sale agreement. This dispute comes as Hipgnosis faces challenges to its business model due to rising interest rates.
