# Global Economy Faces AI Boom Trade Wars and Climate Pressure 


## Navigating Uncertainty: AI Exuberance, Trade Wars, and a Shifting Tech Landscape

This week we explore a trifecta of pressing issues shaping our world. From the escalating trade tensions fueled by Donald Trump's renewed protectionist rhetoric to the undeniable rise of artificial intelligence amidst broader weakness in the tech sector, we delve into the forces reshaping global economics and innovation. Finally, we examine the critical role climate negotiations will play as the world grapples with the urgent need for emissions reduction and global cooperation.

##  Donald Trump Escalates Tariff Threat 
The specter of trade wars looms large once again as Donald Trump pledges to impose steep tariffs if he secures a second term in the White House.  His "America First" agenda, fueled by promises to protect American jobs, targets trading partners with potential 100% tariffs on imports from countries moving away from the US dollar. This aggressive stance has drawn criticism from economists who warn of dire consequences for both the US and global economies, while also highlighting the potential for retaliatory measures from key trading partners.

"If we lost the dollar as the world currency, I think that would be the equivalent of losing a war," Trump declared recently, underscoring his determination to leverage tariffs as a primary tool in international relations. 

## The AI Boom Masks Broader Weakness

While artificial intelligence has ignited investor enthusiasm, leading to massive gains for companies like Nvidia and Microsoft, a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture within the tech sector. Many traditional technology areas are still struggling to regain momentum following a pandemic-induced slowdown. Weak demand, overexpansion during the boom years, and the direct impact of AI advancements on certain sectors have contributed to this broader weakness.

"What we’re seeing in tech is still kind of the unwinding of the over-hiring and overspending that we saw at the beginning of the pandemic," explained Dustin Moskovitz, CEO of Asana, during a recent earnings call. 


## China and US Push Each Other on Climate Priorities Ahead of COP29

With the UN Climate Summit (COP29) approaching in November, the world is watching closely as the US and China engage in crucial climate talks. John Podesta, Washington's chief climate diplomat, recently visited Beijing to urge Chinese leaders to set ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets by 2035, a critical step toward achieving global climate goals.

The discussions highlight the urgency of addressing climate change, particularly as China, the world's largest polluter, grapples with its own rising temperatures and extreme weather events. The outcome of these talks will have far-reaching implications for international efforts to mitigate climate change and secure a sustainable future.

**Conservative activist Leonard Leo has launched a $1bn crusade to "crush" liberal dominance in corporate America and the media.** He aims to challenge private institutions that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, climate concerns, and social issues. **Leo's non-profit advocacy group, Marble Freedom Trust, will direct resources to build conservative talent pipelines in news and entertainment**, and support organizations that call out companies that prioritize left-wing ideology.

**Leo's efforts culminate under Donald Trump's presidency, where three Federalist Society-backed judges were appointed to give conservatives a 6-3 supermajority on the Supreme Court.** Marble has already invested $600mn in its first three years, with plans to spend $1bn. **The non-profit is increasingly interested in launching campaigns against "woke" banks and China-friendly companies**, as well as investing in local media and building conservative coalitions.

Mario Draghi has called for a €800bn EU investment boost to fund radical reform and stop the union falling behind the US and China. He recommends relaxing competition rules, integrating capital markets, and increasing joint procurement in the defence sector. The former Italian premier also advocates for a new trade agenda to increase the EU's economic independence. Draghi warns that without action, Europe will have to compromise its welfare, environment, or freedom. **He estimates an additional investment of €750bn-€800bn per year** is needed to address the EU's lagging competitiveness and bring investment-to-GDP to a level not seen since the 1970s.

Apple launched the iPhone 16, its latest flagship product, with a focus on AI capabilities. The new device is designed from the ground up for AI and features an enhanced Siri voice assistant, photo editing tools, writing aids, and free access to ChatGPT through a partnership with OpenAI. Apple Intelligence will also be available on iPads and MacBooks, marking a long-term play by the company to transform consumer devices. The iPhone 16 will go on sale on September 20, with prices starting at $799 for the base model and up to $1,199 for the Pro Max.

Elon Musk may face a summons from the UK parliament over his role in social media platform X. Labour politician Dawn Butler has announced plans to scrutinize X's use of algorithms, moderation of hateful content, and impact on politics in democracies. This comes after British officials complained about resistance from X in taking down posts deemed a threat to national security during recent riots. If summoned, Musk would be required to give evidence, although MPs cannot force witnesses to appear and the sanction is largely symbolic.

Apple is pinning its hopes on new artificial intelligence-powered software to boost flagging iPhone sales. The tech giant will unveil the iPhone 16, which includes a revamped Siri voice assistant and photo editing features powered by AI models. Market expectations predict about 5% revenue growth in 2025 driven by consumers lured in by new AI features. **Analysts are concerned about the speed at which Apple Intelligence will be rolled out**, creating an unpredictable factor in the company's business. The iPhone made up about 46% of Apple's total revenues in the latest quarter, a marked improvement from this year where revenues fell 10%.

The US Department of Justice has accused Google of running a massive ad tech monopoly that cuts off potential rivals and drives up costs for publishers and advertisers. The trial, which began on Monday, comes after a judge in Washington found Google had monopolized the online search market. **Google dominates the business of displaying online ads**, with a roughly 90% share of ad servers and advertiser networks worldwide. The company has argued it does not have a monopoly and offers a superior product in a highly competitive market.

Multi-manager hedge funds have experienced net client withdrawals of over $30bn for the first time in seven years, according to a report by Goldman Sachs. This is attributed to a change in investor sentiment and lower appetite for these funds. The sector has faced weaker returns last year, with some firms performing poorly compared to larger players like Citadel and Millennium. The report also highlights increasing charges in the sector, including pass-through fees that can range from 3% to 10% of assets. Despite this, the sector shows no signs of losing its importance and relevance in the hedge fund industry. **The average multi-manager return in 2023 was almost identical to the risk-free rate for the year**, highlighting a challenging performance period.

The increasing use of generative AI in job applications has led to a "sea of sameness" where many CVs and cover letters follow a similar format, lacking individuality. This is due to the widespread adoption of preset templates and the ease of using generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google's Bard to create large passages of text. **Many jobseekers are copying and pasting answers from these chatbots**, leading to identical applications being submitted to employers. Experts warn that this can result in bad hires and suggest that AI tools should be used as a tool, not a replacement for personal effort.

Mario Draghi's report on European competitiveness recommends a significant overhaul of the EU's antitrust division, allowing companies to collaborate with rivals on investment and tackling problems as they arise rather than blocking deals before they happen. This approach would give more leeway to dealmaking and collaboration, and focus on innovation rather than consumer prices. The changes aim to help European companies compete with Chinese and American "superstar" companies, but some EU officials fear it would weaken competition policy and allow greater consolidation that could drive up prices.

**European Commission considers sanctions against Slovakia over backsliding on rule of law**

The European Commission is drafting a letter to warn Bratislava that it faces punishment unless it changes policy, following concerns over Prime Minister Robert Fico's increasing clampdown on judicial independence. Brussels is particularly alarmed by the decision to scrap an anti-corruption office and revisions to the criminal code that reduced penalties for crimes ranging from petty theft to fraud and corruption. The commission is also considering clawing back €2.7bn in Covid-19 grants Slovakia has received as part of the EU's pandemic rescue funding.

Starboard Value, an activist investor, has submitted a non-binding proposal to end Murdoch family control at News Corp. The proposal aims to eliminate the dual-class shareholding structure that gives the family 41% voting power despite owning only 14% of the company's equity. **News Corp's board defends the current structure, citing its promotion of stability and long-term strategic goals**. Starboard owns a significant portion of class B shares and has criticized the prospect of supervoting rights being passed to the Murdoch family's children once Rupert relinquishes control.

TV news has been overtaken by digital rivals for the first time in the UK, with online platforms like Facebook and YouTube now more widely used as a source of news. Ofcom's annual study found that 71% of adults obtained news online, compared to 70% via TV. The reach of TV news has fallen from 75% last year, with over four-fifths of people between 16 and 24 obtaining their news from social media. **TV remains the leading platform for news among older age groups**, but a generational shift is underway, with digital platforms expected to become even more dominant in the future.

The Bank of England is urged to sell more short-dated gilts to boost market liquidity, as investors fear a notable liquidity problem in the short end of the gilt market. The central bank has shrunk its gilts portfolio from £875bn to £688bn over two and a half years, but active sales have only covered maturities of three years or longer. **Analysts warn that poor liquidity could create problems in the repo market**, where high-quality collateral such as gilts is temporarily exchanged for cash. Selling short-dated gilts would help boost liquidity and reduce the BoE's balance sheet more smoothly.

Algeria's presidential election results have been disputed by the three candidates, including incumbent President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who was declared the winner with 94.7% of the vote. The joint complaint alleges "vague and contradictory" numbers announced by the National Independent Election Authority (ANIE), which contradicts local counts. Only 5.6mn out of Algeria's 24mn registered voters cast ballots, a turnout rate of 24%, lower than Tebboune's expected support. **Tebboune's legitimacy is being questioned**, and some analysts believe this could be a sign of discord between him and the military-backed regime that controls politics in Algeria.

The US plans economic talks with Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus on September 14-15. The discussions, led by the Treasury department, aim to help Bangladesh boost its economy and address vulnerabilities. **Bangladesh turned to the IMF for a $4.5bn bailout in 2022** after pandemic and war disruptions. US officials will meet with senior Bangladeshi officials, including Yunus, to discuss fiscal and monetary policy, financial sector reforms, and labor reforms. The talks represent the first high-level economic discussions between the two countries since Sheikh Hasina's government was toppled.

The US and Chinese military commanders in the Indo-Pacific held their first call, a significant step towards renewed engagement between the two militaries. **US Indo-Pacific commander Admiral Samuel Paparo** spoke to **General Wu Yanan**, head of the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command, on Tuesday. The call was described as "constructive and respectful" but also saw Paparo urge the PLA to reconsider its use of coercive tactics in the South China Sea. The meeting is a sign of stabilizing US-China relations after a period of tension.

Europe's first collateralized loan ETF is set to list, five years after regulators tightened restrictions on Ucits funds invested in CLOs. The listing of the Fair Oaks AAA CLO ETF comes amid surging demand for similar ETFs in the US, where net inflows hit a record $8.3bn. **The ETF will invest in senior tranches of floating-rate corporate loans**, which have never defaulted since being introduced in 1997. The listing is expected to provide investors with access to a new asset class and increase competition in the European market.

Germany is introducing temporary controls along all its land borders, effective next Monday, to further restrict irregular immigration and protect against Islamist terror and serious crime. The move follows a terror attack in Solingen last month and pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government to toughen up immigration policies. **30,000 people have been turned away since October** along existing border controls with Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Switzerland. Some politicians express concerns that this may damage Europe and the Schengen regime.

The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the UK Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) have a long-standing partnership, dating back to 1909. Today, they work together to resist an assertive Russia and Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine. The CIA and SIS use technology, such as AI and generative AI, to stay ahead in an uncertain world. They also cooperate to disrupt Russian sabotage across Europe and counter the threat of global instability. **Their partnership is built on trust, openness, and friendship**, and they remain champions for global peace and security.

Peter Nygard, a former Canadian fashion mogul, was sentenced to 11 years in jail for sexual assault. A jury found him guilty on four charges of sexual assault and acquitted him on a fifth charge. Nygard faces additional charges in New York and other Canadian cities. He used his wealth and power to lure vulnerable women to sex parties across North America and the Bahamas. **He targeted women and minor-aged girls from disadvantaged backgrounds**, according to the US Department of Justice.

Global investors have warned Italy that its new capital markets rules could undermine corporate governance standards and damage competitiveness. The International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) criticized the rules, which introduce sweeping changes to shareholder voting rights. The rules aim to simplify regulations and boost the capital market but may leave overseas shareholders disadvantaged. ICGN warned that the new system for appointing corporate boards and holding closed-door shareholder meetings could be problematic. They called on the government to rethink certain aspects of the new rules, suggesting a hybrid system instead. **Italy's corporate governance standards are at risk of being undermined**.
