# Global Trends Shaping Interest Rates Insurance and USChina Relations 


## Navigating Uncertainty: Global Trends Shaping Our World

This week's curated articles shed light on pivotal shifts occurring across the globe. From the future trajectory of US interest rates to the evolving landscape of insurance and the complex dynamics between China and the United States, we explore key themes shaping our world today. 


## Fed’s Daly Backs Gradual Interest Rate Cuts

With inflation showing signs of cooling, Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, advocates for a "prudent" approach to interest rate cuts. She believes that recent economic data provides "more confidence" that inflation is under control, suggesting a gradual reduction in borrowing costs from their current range of 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Daly's stance emphasizes the need for careful adjustment rather than a dramatic response to potential signs of slowing economic growth.

## Hiscox Chief Says Rising Insurance Prices Are a 'Stark Signal'

Aki Hussain, CEO of Hiscox, asserts that the surge in insurance and reinsurance prices for natural disasters is sending a "stark signal" to policymakers about the need to limit risks associated with new building projects. The industry has reacted to four consecutive years of global claims exceeding $100 billion by raising premiums and tightening terms and conditions.  Hussain highlights the role of insurers in signaling behavioral change, stating that "ultimately what you are trying to do through pricing is signal a change in behavior."


## China-US Tensions Eroding Co-operation on Science and Tech

Rising tensions between the US and China threaten a 45-year-old science and technology pact due for renewal later this month.  The agreement, initially signed by President Jimmy Carter and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, has underpinned collaboration in areas like energy, agriculture, and disaster management. However, disagreements over semiconductor access, intellectual property concerns, and potential military applications of new technologies have strained the relationship. The struggle to renew the pact reflects how political problems can undermine frontier research work, with implications for crucial collaborative efforts.

Ukraine is blowing up bridges in Russia's Kursk region to consolidate its positions, hampering Russian military logistics. Ukrainian air force chief Mykola Oleshchuk published videos of air strikes destroying two bridges across the river Seym. The attacks also targeted weapons depots and supply lines. Ukraine has claimed control over Sudzha town and set up a military office, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying Russia had used 40 missiles, 750 aerial bombs, and 200 drones against Ukraine in the past week. **Ukraine is not seeking to occupy Russian territory, but rather use it as a bargaining chip in potential future negotiations**.

Elon Musk's X social media company has announced it will shut down its Brazilian operation, effective immediately, due to a clash with the country's supreme court. The company alleges that Justice Alexandre de Moraes threatened its legal representative with arrest for not complying with a "secret order" to take down certain accounts. **X claims this is an example of censorship and a violation of democratic principles**. Musk has sided with right-wing politicians globally, including in Brazil, and has been at odds with the supreme court over freedom of expression issues.

Democrats are defending Kamala Harris's economic plans after they received a cool response from economists and some allies. The plan includes banning price gouging, offering tax relief for families and homebuyers, and focusing on **price gouging**. However, critics say these measures would fail to tackle inflation and could even hit supply. Key Harris allies took to Sunday morning television shows to defend the policies, but others, including economists Jason Furman and Kenneth Rogoff, expressed skepticism. The criticism comes as Trump leads Harris in polls on trustworthiness on the economy and inflation.

Global stocks have recorded their best week since November, rebounding from a recent rout amid easing volatility and reassuring US data. The S&P 500 index broke a four-week losing streak, closing up 3.9% for the week. Japanese stocks surged 7.9% while the Stoxx Europe 600 index added 2.4%. Investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium for clues on interest rates. **Recession fears have eased**, with inflation figures showing a annual rise below 3% and strong US retail sales boosting investor confidence.

Start-up failures in the US have increased by **60%** over the past year, with 254 venture-backed clients going bust in the first quarter of this year. The rate of bankruptcies is now more than seven times higher than in 2019. High-profile company shutdowns include live-streaming website Caffeine and trucking company Convoy. The collapses are due to interest rate rises and a **"crazy fundraising environment"** that left many start-ups stranded. VC investment into early stage companies has plummeted, leaving millions of jobs at risk.

Universal Destinations & Experiences is in talks with UK officials about tax and infrastructure incentives for a multibillion-pound resort in Bedford. The proposed theme park, similar to Universal's US sites, could generate £50bn of economic value to the UK over 20 years. The Labour government's decision on planning will rest with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. **Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy** has expressed support for the project, citing its potential to create thousands of jobs and boost tourism. A decision on whether to proceed is expected by the end of the year.

Iron ore prices have hit a two-year low, wiping $100bn off the market value of leading miners BHP, Rio Tinto, Vale, and Fortescue. The price drop is attributed to China's stricken property sector, which has depressed steel demand. As a result, iron ore prices have plunged by over 30% since the start of the year, with prices for delivery to Qingdao slipping to $92.2 per tonne, below the key $100 mark. This has squeezed earnings at the world's largest mining houses and led to stockpiles rising 28% to 150.4mn tonnes.

**Italy's Olympic gold victory has sparked a debate over nationality and citizenship laws.** The country's women's volleyball team, which includes players of African migrant background, won the first-ever Olympic gold medal in their category. However, this success was marred by the vandalism of a mural celebrating one of the star players, Paola Egonu, who is the daughter of Nigerian parents. This incident has led to calls for faster naturalisation processes for children born to immigrant parents educated in Italy. **Many are advocating for birthright citizenship or simplified naturalisation procedures**, citing demographic crisis and the need for integration.

South Korea's plan to introduce artificial intelligence-powered digital textbooks in schools has sparked a backlash from parents and academics. The government says the tablets will help teachers assess students' learning levels and pace, providing tailored education for each student. However, many parents are concerned about children's overexposure to digital devices and potential misinformation. Some experts warn that AI in the classroom risks "getting out of control" due to the spread of false information and leaks of personal data. **Over 50,000 parents have signed a petition demanding greater consideration for students' wellbeing**.

**US stock markets have rebounded after a dramatic start to August, but trading in derivatives markets suggests investors are still cautious.**

The S&P 500 has erased its month-to-date losses and the Vix index (Wall Street's gauge of expected market volatility) has fallen below its long-term average. However, the "Vvix" (expected volatility of expected volatility) closed at 103.4, indicating continued anxiety in the market.

Investors are watching for signs of economic slowdown, which could shift the narrative and increase volatility levels. The put-call skew, a measure of demand for protection against a market pullback, has remained higher than its recent averages. **Despite gains, defensive sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare have outperformed cyclical areas.**

China and the Philippines are trading accusations over a collision between their ships in the South China Sea. **A Chinese coast guard vessel claimed that a Philippine ship rammed it** near the Second Thomas Shoal, a reef within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone but claimed by China. The Philippines responded with its own statement, accusing China of responsibility and saying there were two ramming incidents on Monday. Tensions have been rising in the region despite a détente between the sides last month.

Tata Sons has expressed interest in buying some of India's debt-laden state-owned power distribution companies. Tata Power, the energy arm of the conglomerate, would consider expanding its distribution reach if public companies are put on the block. The government aims to ease blackouts and stem huge losses in the sector, which has an accumulated deficit of $74.4bn. **Tata Power is well-positioned to take advantage of potential reforms**, with experience cutting power distribution's technical and commercial losses.

Investors are closely watching the Kansas City Federal Reserve's Economic Policy Symposium at Jackson Hole for clues about US rate cuts. A weaker-than-expected US payrolls report sparked fears of a recession, but subsequent data have damped down predictions of a jumbo 0.5 percentage point cut in September. **Markets are currently pricing in three to four quarter-point cuts this year**. The next Fed interest rate decision is due on September 18.

Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) is expected to keep benchmark lending rates unchanged, despite slower growth and lower consumer confidence. **The PBoC may cut the reverse repo rate by 0.25 percentage points in the second half of the year**. Chinese policymakers are also trying to create a floor for long-dated bond yields to avoid a bubble.

In the Eurozone, investors will be looking for clues about economic health from business activity survey data next week. **Most economists expect the S&P Global purchasing managers' index to stay above 50**, but some predict a dip below expectations.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has imposed nearly $400mn in fines on 26 Wall Street firms for using personal devices and apps like WhatsApp to discuss company business without preserving records of those conversations. The investigation, which started with investment bankers, is ongoing, with BlackRock, Blackstone, Invesco, and Moody's being contacted by the SEC. Some companies have set aside tens of millions of dollars to cover expected penalties, raising concerns about the regulator's overstepping its bounds and pursuing creative enforcement theories.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Sunday as part of Washington's diplomatic push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. **The US, Qatar, and Egypt are mediating the talks** to secure an agreement to end the 10-month war and free hostages held in Gaza. Despite some progress being made, significant gaps remain between Israeli and Hamas positions. **Israel is insisting on maintaining a military presence along the Philadelphi corridor**, which has been rejected by Hamas. Blinken's arrival comes ahead of a meeting later this week where mediators hope to broker a ceasefire based on a three-stage plan proposed by US President Joe Biden.

Goldman Sachs was left shell-shocked when a colleague, Ronan O'Grady, was sentenced to two years in prison for eight counts of sexual assault. Despite being convicted and sentenced, O'Grady continued working at the bank until his imprisonment. The case raises questions about whose responsibility it is to inform employers of an employee's arrest or conviction.

Law enforcement typically do not inform employers about suspects in investigations to avoid breaching privacy laws. Employers largely rely on employees' integrity and trust. In some cases, the onus is on the employee to inform their employer.

The Goldman Sachs case highlights the difficulties employers face in monitoring such situations. The bank's employment policies require staff to notify them of any arrests or charges, but O'Grady concealed his conviction until June 2024.
