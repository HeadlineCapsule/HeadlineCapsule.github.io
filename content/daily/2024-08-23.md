# AI Reshaping Infrastructure and Software Development  


##  From Power Plants to Code: The Future Takes Shape

This week we delve into the fascinating world of technological innovation, exploring how AI is reshaping both infrastructure and software development. We'll examine the trend of repurposing old power stations for data centers, and then explore how AI-powered coding assistants are revolutionizing the way developers work. Finally, we'll look at a new study that sheds light on effective climate change policies.

## Tech Industry Taps Old Power Stations to Expand AI Infrastructure

As demand for artificial intelligence skyrockets, tech giants are turning to an unexpected resource: old power stations and industrial sites.  These locations often have existing infrastructure like high-power transmission lines and access to water - crucial elements for energy-hungry data centers. Microsoft plans to develop data centers on the sites of former power plants near Leeds, England, while Amazon is targeting a similar project in Virginia.

This trend reflects the growing challenges of finding suitable land for data centers and the need to find more sustainable solutions. Repurposing existing infrastructure not only reduces environmental impact but also offers a practical solution to meet the ever-growing demand for computing power.

## AI-Powered Coding Pulls in Almost $1bn of Funding to Claim ‘Killer App’ Status


Software engineering is rapidly embracing the transformative power of AI, with AI-driven coding assistants amassing nearly $1 billion in funding since last year. Companies like Replit and GitHub are developing tools that can write and edit code, significantly boosting developer productivity.

GitHub Copilot, for example, has already garnered over 2 million paying subscribers, driving a 40% increase in GitHub's revenue growth.  As Hadi Partovi, CEO of Code.org, points out: "Today, software engineering and coding is the number-one area impacted by AI... At this point, software engineering without AI is a little bit like writing without a word processor."

## Climate Policy Success Needs Mix of Three Factors, Study Finds

A new study analyzing climate policies across 41 countries reveals that the most successful approaches combine financial incentives (like subsidies), regulatory measures (such as bans on coal-fired power plants), and pricing mechanisms (carbon taxes).  

For example, the UK's success in phasing out coal-powered electricity relied on a combination of regulations and tax incentives. The research highlights the need for multifaceted strategies that address both economic and environmental factors to effectively tackle climate change. This insight is particularly crucial as nations prepare to submit updated climate plans in 2025.

US Vice-President Kamala Harris has vowed to "strengthen, not abdicate" America's global leadership and promised to ensure the country wins the competition for the 21st century. In a speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris spoke about conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, including Gaza, and pledged to stand strong with Ukraine and NATO allies. She also criticized Donald Trump for cosying up to tyrants and dictators, ** promising to "never waver" in defense of America's security and ideals**. Harris appealed for national unity and called on independent voters to support her candidacy.

Donald Trump has expressed interest in an endorsement from Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is ending his presidential campaign after falling in the polls. Kennedy's campaign has run out of money and he is now polling at 4.7%, far behind Joe Biden's replacement Kamala Harris. **Trump said he would be "honoured" by an endorsement from Kennedy**, but it remains unclear whether Kennedy's backers would shift their allegiance to Trump or vote for Harris instead. Kennedy's campaign has been marked by bizarre moments and controversy over his anti-vaccine positions.

AstraZeneca has threatened to move its vaccine manufacturing site on Merseyside to Philadelphia or India due to a deadlock in negotiations with the UK government over state aid for the project. The company had initially been promised £90mn in grants, but the government now wants to reduce this to £40mn. **AstraZeneca is considering relocating the planned vaccine operation** to take advantage of more generous financial support offered by the US or Indian governments. This could result in the UK importing vaccines instead of exporting them, losing sovereign capability.

The world's second-largest diamond, weighing 2,492 carats, has been discovered in Botswana by Canadian mining company Lucara Diamond. The stone is the biggest known gem-quality find after the Cullinan diamond and could be worth up to **$40mn**. The discovery comes as a boost for the diamond sector, which has been affected by the rise of lab-grown stones and decreased luxury spending. The stone will likely be used to drive interest in the diamond market, with potential buyers including private collectors and luxury jewelry houses.

BlackRock's support for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) proposals has declined significantly since 2021. According to its annual investment stewardship report, the asset manager supported just 20 of 493 environmental and social proposals, or about 4% of the total. This compares to a high of 47% in 2021. BlackRock cited concerns that many proposals were "overly prescriptive" or lacked economic merit as reasons for its declining support. The company's governance-related activities, however, saw an increase in support. **BlackRock's opposition to conservative-backed anti-ESG resolutions also contributed to the decline**.

**Nestlé CEO Mark Schneider Steps Down, Replaced by Laurent Freixe**

Nestlé announced that CEO Mark Schneider is stepping down after 8 years at the helm. He will be succeeded by company veteran **Laurent Freixe**, who has worked at Nestlé for nearly 40 years. The move comes as the company faces challenges including underperformance and mishaps such as IT system integration issues and regulatory investigations. **Freixe's immediate priorities** will be to expand market share and boost organic growth, with a focus on delivering consistent and sustainable value creation.

Gatwick airport is experiencing a "busiest summer" with an 8% increase in passenger growth in the first half of the year. The airport's CEO, Stewart Wingate, hopes to secure government approval for expansion plans as early as next February, which would enable it to handle up to **75mn passengers** per year by the late 2030s. Passenger numbers have rebounded with around **19.9mn** passing through the airport in the first six months, a 7.7% increase on the same period last year. Revenues and profits have also increased, with revenues up **15.3%** to £488mn.

Argentina's senate has approved a bill increasing pension spending, dealing a blow to President Javier Milei's campaign to balance the country's budget. The 61-8 vote in favor of the new formula for calculating pensions updates them to account for Argentina's triple-digit inflation. Milei has vowed to veto the bill, but legislators are likely to override it with a two-thirds majority. This defeat is a disappointment for Milei, who was elected on a pledge to eliminate Argentina's fiscal deficit and bring down inflation. **The new pension formula will increase costs by 0.44% of GDP this year**.

Meyer Werft, a German cruise ship builder, is on the brink of collapse due to high energy and raw material costs. The company needs €2.7bn to finance construction of its order book, which includes contracts negotiated before the Covid-19 pandemic. **The German government has pledged to help rescue the company** through a bailout package that could involve the federal government and Lower Saxony becoming shareholders. The shipyard's collapse would be a disaster for the surrounding region, with 18,000 people dependent on it for their livelihood.

The US has warned that Mexico's judicial reforms pose a "major risk" to democracy, threatening to deepen diplomatic rifts between the two countries. US Ambassador Ken Salazar criticized President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's plan to replace judges via elections, saying it would make it easier for cartels and bad actors to take advantage of inexperienced judges. The comments come as Mexico's Congress prepares to vote on the reforms, which have been met with criticism from American lawmakers and business groups. **Mexico's relations with the US are already strained** over issues like migration and trade.

The president of the Boston Federal Reserve, Susan Collins, warned against "self-fulfilling" pessimism on the US economy, stating that it could raise the risk of a downturn. Despite concerns about inflation, Collins believes the economy is in a good place and sees a clear path to achieving both price stability and a healthy labour market without an unnecessary slowdown. She supports adjusting interest rates to ease policy and stimulate economic growth. Other Fed officials have also expressed support for rate cuts, citing a slow, methodical approach.

Uber has partnered with GM's Cruise to offer self-driving car rides on its platform. This deal comes after a series of setbacks for Cruise, including a high-profile crash last year that injured a pedestrian and triggered investigations into its technology. The partnership will make Cruise's autonomous cars available to Uber riders in an undisclosed city from next year. **Uber's CEO said this partnership will help introduce autonomous technology safely and reliably**. This deal is part of Uber's push to become the go-to platform for consumers looking to ride in autonomous vehicles.

The Bank of Japan's governor, Kazuo Ueda, warned that global markets remain **unstable** due to concerns about the US economy. Despite this, he reaffirmed his commitment to raising interest rates if inflation and economic growth continue on track. The central bank ended its negative interest rate policy in March, but critics argue that confusing messages accompanied the July rate decision. Ueda defended the 0.15 percentage point increase, citing a need to "reaffirm" a healthy economy. **Market volatility** has been significant, with the yen weakening and then surging against the dollar.

JD Sports posted a jump in sales in its second quarter, with like-for-like growth of 2.4% and a rise in US sales by 5.7%. The retailer credited the success of its store rollout programme and attributed the quarterly improvement to the strength and agility of its multi-brand model. Analysts said this performance was impressive despite weakness at Nike, with one analyst estimating that JD Sports is well-placed to outperform in the next 12 months. **JD Sports' sales growth has offset a decline in the UK and Europe**, with shares up 9% in early trading.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have threatened to overshadow Kamala Harris's primetime speech at the Democratic National Convention with a large march through Chicago on Thursday night. The march, expected to draw tens of thousands of people, coincides with Harris's speech and is in response to her administration's support for Israel's war in Gaza. Protesters claim this will cost her votes and that Harris has done nothing to win their support. **The protesters demand a ceasefire and an end to US arms supplies to Israel**, while Harris has reiterated her support for a ceasefire, but not taken further action.

**Bodies Recovered from Sunk Yacht**

The bodies of UK tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and four guests on the superyacht Bayesian have been recovered, three days after it sank off the coast of Sicily. The victims include Christopher Morvillo, Jonathan Bloomer, their wives Neda and Judy, and Recaldo Thomas, the boat's chef. Hannah Lynch, Mike's 18-year-old daughter, is still missing. Authorities are investigating the exact circumstances of the shipwreck after eyewitnesses claimed it sank in minutes. The incident has caused immense grief among the families and friends of the victims, with tributes paid to Lynch as a "pioneering titan of UK technology".
