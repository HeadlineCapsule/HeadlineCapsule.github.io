# Economic Boom or Bust?
In a recent speech, Donald Trump promised a "brand new Trump economic boom" if he wins the 2024 presidential election, but warned of a "1929-style depression" if he loses. Meanwhile, Apple is opening up its tap-to-pay technology to other developers, and the US inflation rate has fallen to 2.9%.

## Trump Promises Economic Boom
Donald Trump has promised that the 2024 presidential election will bring “a brand new Trump economic boom” if he wins or a “1929-style depression” if he loses. In an hour-long speech focused on the economy, Trump promised to bring down the price of cars, housing, insurance and prescription drugs — and bashed the Biden administration for overseeing a rise in consumer prices. He also vowed to continue his 2017 tax cuts and pay off the national debt.

## Apple Opens Up Tap-to-Pay Technology
Apple will open the contactless payments technology on its iPhone to third-party developers in multiple countries, following regulatory pressure from authorities in the US and EU. Developers will have access to Apple’s NFC chip, which powers its tap-to-pay features, in the beta version of its new operating system, iOS 18.1. The move comes after the company agreed to open up access to the NFC chip in the EU in a settlement with the bloc’s antitrust regulator.

## US Inflation Rate Falls to 2.9%
The US inflation rate has fallen to 2.9%, according to recent data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The decrease is due in part to a decline in housing-related expenses, which accounted for nearly 90% of the monthly increase in consumer prices. The news comes as a relief to consumers who have been feeling the pinch of high inflation rates, and may indicate that the economy is starting to slow down.

Germany's chief prosecutor has issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man, Volodymyr Z (also known as Zhuravlov), suspected of blowing up the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea nearly two years ago. The suspect had been living in Poland but moved to Ukraine before he could be arrested. This marks a breakthrough in the investigation into one of Europe's most spectacular acts of sabotage. Russia and Ukraine had long accused each other of being behind the explosion, which drastically reduced Moscow's ability to use energy exports as leverage over Europe.

**Ukraine launches drone attack on Russian airfields**, with Kyiv's forces facing increased resistance nine days into their incursion into Russia. **117 drones and missiles were fired** in the Kursk, Voronezh, Belgorod, and Nizhny Novgorod regions, targeting Russian military airfields. Ukraine's security service described it as the war's largest drone attack on Russian airfields. The operation aims to prevent Russian air attacks on Ukraine, but concerns have been raised about weakening defences in strategically important areas.

Kamala Harris has spent $57mn on digital advertising since becoming the Democrat's presidential candidate, 10 times as much as Donald Trump. This spending surge has helped draw money into her campaign war chest for an election battle against Trump that is expected to be the costliest White House race ever. Harris's digital ad blitz is part of $139mn spent on tech platforms by the Biden-Harris campaign since the start of the year, compared with $22.5mn from Trump and groups supporting his run.

**WHO Declares Mpox Public Health Emergency**

The World Health Organization (WHO) has triggered a public health emergency due to a surge in mpox cases, primarily in Africa. At least 13 countries have reported outbreaks, with 2,863 cases and 517 deaths this year. The more severe clade 1b variant has been detected in several countries. **Limited access to testing in rural areas means confirmed case counts are underestimated**. WHO is urging the world to help tackle the outbreak and has called on vaccine-makers to apply for emergency use approvals.

ChatGPT users in the UK have been experiencing a glitch where the chatbot responds in Welsh to English-language queries. This issue has been reported by several users, including entrepreneurs and media outlets, despite them not speaking Welsh or living near Wales. **OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, admits that their model has "much worse than expected performance" in Welsh**, due to misclassified training data. The glitch is attributed to a limitation with ChatGPT's voice transcription system, Whisper, which gets confused and transcribes audio in a different language. Users are advised to set their speech setting to English to minimize the issue.

Hedge funds and private equity firms are fighting back against a new rule proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would require them to disclose more information about their investments. The SEC says the rule is necessary to protect investors, but hedge funds claim it's an overreach of authority. The issue has become even more contentious since the Supreme Court overturned a landmark legal doctrine that gave federal agencies significant latitude in crafting rules. As a result, pursuing a broad regulatory agenda like this one may become even more challenging for the SEC. **The SEC's efforts to regulate hedge funds have been met with resistance from the industry**, which sees the rule as an attempt to clamp down on their activities without a mandate from lawmakers.

Hedge fund Caxton made gains of about $270mn this month, betting on US government debt and the Japanese yen. The London-based firm's Macro fund returned 3.9% in the first nine days of August, while its Global fund gained 1.1%. The profits came during a turbulent month for global markets, driven by fears of a slowing economy. Caxton's success was helped by bets on short-dated US Treasuries and the yen, which rallied strongly against the dollar. This leaves Caxton Macro up 9.9% so far this year, while the Global fund is up 5.2%.

The UK government has pledged to continue investing in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, despite scrapping £1.3bn of support for technology projects. The decision to cancel funding for a £800mn supercomputer at the University of Edinburgh has sparked a backlash from Labour and experts, who warn the UK is lagging behind international peers in supercomputing. **The government claims it will "get it right" with a new approach**, focusing on an AI action plan and delivering compute needs through an "AI action plan".

German police temporarily sealed off an air base near Cologne due to suspected sabotage, amid fears that the facility's water supply had been contaminated. An intruder is believed to have entered the base and carried out an act of sabotage, prompting a security investigation. The incident comes as European capitals heighten concerns about Russian plots for violent acts across the continent. **Russian intelligence agencies believe Russia has prepared covert bombings, arson attacks, and infrastructure damage in Europe**.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has sued the country's stock exchange, ASX, over a botched blockchain upgrade project. ASIC alleges that ASX made "misleading and deceptive" statements about the project, which was abandoned in 2022 after repeated delays. The regulator claims that ASX did not have a reasonable basis to imply the project was on track to meet future milestones. **ASX's settlement systems are considered critical national infrastructure**, and ASIC believes this was a collective failure by the exchange's board and senior executives.

**Twenty-six Wall Street companies, including Ameriprise, Edward Jones, and LPL Financial, have agreed to pay $393mn to the SEC to settle charges over employee texting and messaging on platforms like WhatsApp about business matters.**

* The fines range from $400,000 to $50mn per company.
* The investigation has expanded beyond big investment banks to broker-dealers and investment advisers.
* The SEC's probe has resulted in roughly $2bn in financial penalties against dozens of companies through record-keeping investigations since 2021.
* Industry advocates have protested the inquiry's expanding parameters, saying the SEC is overstepping its bounds.

Shareholders' lawyers in a $1bn Dell case have been awarded $267mn in fees by Delaware's top court, rejecting claims that the award was excessive. The decision comes as another court weighs a potential multibillion-dollar award to lawyers who canceled Elon Musk's $56bn pay package. The lower court had justified the fee award as being equal to roughly 27% of the settlement, but a hedge fund argued it was too high, citing a sliding percentage scale typically used by US federal courts. **The Delaware Supreme Court agreed that the lower court had "more than adequately justified its fee award".**

US farmers are bracing for the impact of potential tariffs on Chinese imports, which could further burden an already struggling sector. Farmers have been hit by high interest rates, falling commodity prices, and trade wars started during Trump's presidency. Tariffs placed on Chinese imports led to retaliatory charges from China on US pork and soybean exports, causing farm debt and closures in crucial battleground states.

**Farmers are concerned about additional tariffs**, which could add $64 to the value of a pig if 60% levies are imposed on incoming products. The threat of new tariffs comes as weak crop prices, dwindling livestock, high borrowing costs, and operating expenses take a toll on farmers. **Net farm income is expected to fall by 25.5% in 2024**.

Flutter is in exclusive talks to buy Playtech's Italian business, Snaitech, for £2bn. Shares in both companies rose after the announcement. The deal would value Flutter at around £2bn and give it a 30.3% market share in Italy, overtaking Lottomatica's 29.1%. This is part of Flutter's strategy to consolidate its position in the Italian online gaming market, which is considered one of the most underpenetrated markets in Europe. The acquisition would be a significant expansion for Flutter, which already has a dominant market position in the US.

**Top Fed official 'open' to September rate cut as inflation cools**

Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said he is "open" to an interest rate cut in September, citing signs of cooling inflation and a weakening labor market. Bostic warned that the Fed can't afford to be late in easing monetary policy due to potential risks. The comments bolster market expectations for a rate cut this year, with traders predicting a full percentage point reduction by 2024. Bostic's shift in stance comes after July's inflation data showed annual consumer price growth below 3%, giving him greater confidence that the economy is on track to meet its 2% target.

**Barclays Reviewing Its Exposure to Israel Amid Pro-Palestinian Activist Pressure**
Barclays, a UK bank, has drawn up plans to pull out of future Israeli government bond auctions due to pressure from pro-Palestinian activists. However, the bank informed Israeli officials that it would continue to work as a primary dealer in the market. This decision comes after internal discussions and amid criticism about Barclays' relations with Israel during the war in Gaza. The move reflects the economic fallout from the conflict, which has also seen countries like Colombia suspend coal exports to Israel and Turkey halt trade until humanitarian aid is allowed into Gaza.

Radical Ventures has raised nearly $800mn for its third institutional fund, focusing exclusively on growth-stage AI start-ups. The Toronto-based venture capital firm's investors include former Google chief Eric Schmidt's family office and Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li. **This is the largest fund of its kind for AI**, with a focus on backing companies transitioning from early stage to growth. Despite some questioning the returns from AI investments, Jordan Jacobs, co-founder of Radical Ventures, believes there will continue to be a lot of money invested in the space.
