# Economic Uncertainty Looms as Consumer Spending Slows
The US economy is facing a growing concern as consumer spending slows down, affecting businesses across various industries.

## SoftBank Launches ¥1tn Buyback Amid Pressure from Elliott
SoftBank has announced a ¥1tn buyback program, marking a significant shift in its strategy. The move comes after the company faced pressure from activist investor Elliott Management to return capital to shareholders. According to Yoshimitsu Goto, SoftBank's chief financial officer, the decision was made independently and not influenced by external factors.

## US Consumer Spending Slowdown Weighs on Travel and Leisure Groups
The slowdown in consumer spending is having a significant impact on travel and leisure companies. Disney theme parks have seen a decline in operating profit due to rising food and labor costs. Chris Nassetta, Hilton's chief executive, noted that US consumers are reining in their spending on travel as they face less disposable income.

## Common Threads
The three articles highlight the growing uncertainty in the US economy, particularly with regards to consumer spending. The slowdown in consumer spending is affecting various industries, from technology to travel and leisure.

Ukraine launched a surprise military incursion into Russia's Kursk region, sparking heavy battles with Russian forces. The operation involves Ukrainian conventional forces, making it more significant than previous cross-border operations. Ukraine has taken control of several villages, shot down aircraft, and destroyed military vehicles. Russian authorities reported 28 residents wounded and at least five killed. The attack comes at a critical moment for Ukraine, which is losing territory to Russia's larger army and faces potential collapse in US support. **Key entities:** Ukraine, Russia, Kursk region.

Google and Meta made a secret deal to target ads for Instagram on YouTube, skirting Google's own rules for minors. The project targeted 13-17 year olds using the "unknown" audience group, which skewed towards under-18s. This workaround circumvented Google's policies against personalizing ads to minors. The tie-up originated in early 2023 and was initially successful, with plans to expand internationally and promote other Meta apps. However, Google has now cancelled the project after allegations came to light.

Nasa is considering using SpaceX to shuttle two astronauts, Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, back to Earth from the International Space Station. The pair were supposed to return nearly two months ago but technical difficulties with the Boeing CST-100 Starliner spacecraft have delayed their departure. Nasa has pushed back a planned SpaceX mission until September to weigh whether it should bring the astronauts home early. Officials are evaluating multiple options for returning Williams and Wilmore, including using another spacecraft or reconfiguring the Starliner's software parameters.

The global unwinding of the yen "carry trade" has the potential to destabilize markets further. The carry trade, which involves borrowing in a low-interest-rate country (Japan) to fund investment in assets elsewhere that offer higher returns, has grown to become one of the biggest ever iterations of the bet. **$500bn** of cumulative dollar-yen carry trades were built since 2011, with about half of that extended during the past two to three years. The unwinding of these positions has contributed to market turbulence, including a sell-off on Monday.

*Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is making a strong push for Latino voters, hoping to stem the slide in support for the party among this key demographic.*

Harris has been campaigning aggressively in swing districts and courting Latino voters, with her approval rating among Latinos at 53%, compared to Biden's 50% and Trump's 43%. Her selection as the presumptive nominee has increased interest in voter registration and fundraising. A recent poll showed she had an 18-point lead over Trump among Latino voters in battleground states.

The UK's biggest private pension fund, the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), has sold £80mn of Israeli assets following public pressure from its members. The move is in response to concerns over Israel's human rights record in occupied Palestinian territories since the start of the war with Hamas last year. USS has "materially" reduced its exposure to Israeli investments, including government debt and currency, citing a legal duty to invest in the best financial interests of its members. This follows similar actions by other major global retirement funds that have pulled back their Israel exposure.

Investors who put tens of billions into funds offering protection from volatility suffered sharp losses during this week's stock sell-off. **Covered call** ETFs, which involve buying stocks while selling derivatives tied to the underlying assets, have seen inflows driven by equity-like price gains combined with bond-style income and low volatility. However, when markets move quickly, the relatively small income generated is not enough to offset the decline in shares, resulting in underperformance and sharp swings. These funds are not suitable for long-term investors, who give up a lot of upside.

Qantas has slashed former CEO Alan Joyce's exit pay by more than A$9.3mn, due to damage done to the company's reputation in his last year of tenure. The decision was made after a review found that Joyce's leadership style contributed to the crisis that hit the airline in 2023. Joyce's short-term and long-term bonuses were cut as a result, with his entire long-term incentive bonus being forfeited. The review recommended changes to Qantas' management practices, including more focus on employees and customers.

Bill Ackman's Pershing Square is considering a deal to take Howard Hughes Holdings, a $3bn real estate company, private. Pershing Square, the largest shareholder with 38% stake, has tapped Jefferies to evaluate the deal and may seek co-investors for financing. This comes as Ackman's hedge fund faces setbacks, including a pulled IPO of Pershing's US entity. Howard Hughes has streamlined its business, splitting off its entertainment division in July. The proposed deal could be a significant escalation of Pershing Square's investment in the group.

Anduril Industries, a US defence tech start-up, has raised $1.5bn at a valuation of $14bn. The funds will be used to accelerate production of autonomous weapons for the US military and its allies. The company values simplicity in manufacturing techniques, using commercial methods like Tesla's as a blueprint. Anduril aims to mass-produce tens of thousands of autonomous systems to address urgent needs of the US and its allies. This investment reflects shifting sentiment among venture capitalists towards defence tech since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Warner Bros Discovery wrote down the value of its traditional television networks by $9.1bn, a dramatic recognition of how fast streaming is eroding the cable business model. The non-cash charge led to a quarterly net loss of $10bn, exceeding total revenue of $9.7bn. Shares dropped over 9% in after-hours trading. Revenue at WBD's television business unit fell 8% from a year ago to $5.3bn. The company's streaming and HBO cable businesses added 3.6mn subscribers in the quarter, reaching 103.3mn globally.

Japanese shares rallied on Wednesday after a Bank of Japan official downplayed further interest rate rises, citing volatile global trade. Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida said maintaining current monetary easing was necessary, suggesting no immediate rate hikes in Japan. The yen fell as traders discounted the risk of over-tightening by the BoJ.

The Topix index closed 2.3% higher, with gains led by banking groups Sumitomo Mitsui and MUFG. Markets in Asia followed suit, with Korea's Kospi index up 1.8%, Taiwan's benchmark index rising almost 4%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbing over 1%.

The UK government plans to introduce a bill to regulate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating agencies next year. The move aims to increase transparency in the sector, which has significant influence over trillions of pounds' worth of investments. The regulations will bring the UK in line with other leading economies, including the EU. The Financial Conduct Authority will set the rules for the new regime, and the industry is seeking clarity on the proposals. The goal is to ensure that ESG ratings are derived from transparent and objective methods, rather than opaque criteria.

The NHS in England has approved a £1.7mn treatment for beta thalassemia using Crispr gene editing technology, the first of its kind in Europe. The drug, Casgevy, works by removing and editing patient cells to produce healthy red blood cells. This treatment could permanently cure patients with severe beta thalassemia, freeing them from regular blood transfusions. The approval is funded through the Innovative Medicines Fund, a ringfenced pot of NHS funding for expensive new medicines. This marks a significant milestone in gene therapy and has the potential to treat many other genetic diseases.

Austria's economy minister Martin Kocher is set to become the country's next central bank president, replacing Robert Holzmann in a year. [**Kocher**](#) has been nominated for the role by Austria's Finance Ministry and his appointment is expected to be formally approved by President Alexander Van der Bellen. Kocher has no political affiliation and his stance on monetary policy is largely unknown.

*Holzmann*, one of the most hawkish members of the European Central Bank's governing council, will step down next August. The central bank also announced new appointments to its executive board, including Edeltraud Stiftinger as deputy governor.

A Polish man has been sentenced to prison and deportation for punching Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in June. The 39-year-old man was convicted of assaulting Frederiksen, who suffered whiplash from the incident. He also pleaded guilty to other offences, including groping a woman and fraud. Frederiksen did not testify in court but her bodyguard testified against him. The attack raised concerns about political violence in Europe. The perpetrator will serve four months in prison before being deported and banned from re-entering Denmark for six years.

Thailand's Constitutional Court has ordered the dissolution of the Move Forward party, which won last year's election but was blocked from power by the conservative establishment. The court also ruled that the party's top leadership, including Pita Limjaroenrat, would be banned from politics for 10 years. The move is seen as an attempt to silence the party's call to reform Thailand's harsh lèse majesté law, which criminalizes insults to the monarch and carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison **[Lèse Majesté Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lèse_majesté)**. The dissolution has sparked political uncertainty in Thailand.

Telegram usage surged in the UK on July 29, with active users rising to 3.1mn, following a mass stabbing in Southport that turned into a night of rioting linked to the far-right English Defence League (EDL). The EDL was believed to be behind some of the violence, which left at least 50 police officers injured. Tech Against Terrorism issued an "urgent alert" regarding the organization of UK riots by far-right extremists using Telegram. Telegram said its moderators are actively monitoring the situation and removing channels and posts containing calls to violence.
