# UK Government Reconsiders Forcing Tech Firms to Remove Harmful Content
The UK government is reevaluating its decision to abandon a proposal that would force internet companies to remove "legal but harmful" content, following recent far-right riots and concerns over social media's role in fueling violence.

## Social Media Firms Face Scrutiny Over Handling of Hate Speech
Social media giants are under fire for their handling of hate speech and misinformation on their platforms. The UK government has launched an investigation into the worst agitators behind the violent disorder, and is considering strengthening online regulation to address concerns over the spread of harmful content.

## Online Safety Act Set to Govern Social Media Platforms
The Online Safety Act was passed last year to govern social media platforms and ensure they take responsibility for removing harmful content. However, officials have raised concerns that some websites are being too slow to take down criminal content, and that major social media firms are failing to enforce their own rules on hate speech.

The three articles highlight the growing concern over social media's role in spreading hate speech and misinformation, and the need for stronger regulation to address these issues. The UK government's reconsideration of its proposal to force tech firms to remove harmful content is a significant development, and one that could have far-reaching implications for online safety and free speech.

**Susan Wojcicki, former CEO of YouTube, has died at 56**

Susan Wojcicki, one of Google's earliest employees and YouTube's former chief executive, has passed away after a two-year battle with non-small cell lung cancer. **She was a trailblazer in the tech industry**, helping to create Google's all-conquering advertising business and advocating for parental leave. During her tenure at YouTube, she nurtured the development of the "creator economy" and oversaw the platform's growth to 2.5 billion monthly active users. Her death is a loss to many, including **Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO**, who called her "an incredible person, leader, and friend".

Sanford "Sandy" Robertson, a pioneering Silicon Valley financier, has passed away at 93. He was one of the earliest bankers to sense the potential of technological innovations emerging from the suburbs south of San Francisco in the 1970s and 1980s. **Robertson's firm, Robertson Stephens, underwrote hundreds of technology companies**, including Pixar Studios, eBay, E*Trade, AOL, and Dell. He was a private equity investor and close adviser to Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff. Robertson was also a listed producer of nearly 30 Broadway shows, including Hamilton, and raised racehorses.

**Israeli air strike on Gaza shelter kills around 100 people**

An Israeli air strike tore through a Gaza City shelter housing displaced Palestinians, killing around 100 people. The strike on the Al Taba'een school came during dawn prayers and was confirmed by the Israeli military as targeting a "Hamas command and control centre". Local authorities in Gaza City called it a "massacre" and emergency personnel worked to locate and evacuate the injured from the rubble. The US National Security Council expressed deep concern over civilian casualties and urged Israel to minimize harm.
