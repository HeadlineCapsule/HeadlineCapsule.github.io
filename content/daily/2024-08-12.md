# European Gas Market Under Pressure
The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has sent shockwaves through the European gas market. With tensions escalating, traders are shying away from using Ukraine's vast natural gas storage facilities.

## Ukraine's Storage Facilities Lie Dormant
European traders are using only a fraction of Ukraine's underground storage capacity, following Russian attacks that drove up risks and deprived the war-torn country of scarce revenues. "Persistent Russian attacks on Ukrainian storage facilities increase the risk of storing gas," said Marco Saalfrank, head of continental Europe merchant trading at energy group Axpo.

## Price Differentials Fail to Entice Traders
The price differentials between summer and winter natural gas prices have narrowed significantly this year, making it less attractive for traders to inject gas into Ukraine's storage facilities. Last year, the difference was often above â‚¬20 per megawatt hour in the summer, but this year it was only around â‚¬5/MWh.

## Connecting Threads
The three articles highlight the growing uncertainty and risks associated with the European gas market. As tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to escalate, traders are becoming increasingly cautious, leading to a decline in gas storage injections. This trend is likely to have far-reaching implications for the region's energy security and prices.

Kamala Harris is more trusted than Donald Trump on handling the US economy, according to a new poll. The survey found 42% of voters trust Harris more, compared to 41% who trust Trump. This marks a sharp change in voter sentiment following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the White House race. **Harris also enjoys a higher approval rating than Biden**, with 46% of registered voters approving of her job as vice-president, compared to 41% for the president. The poll suggests Harris may be able to distance herself from Biden on economic issues.

**Ukrainian Troops Continue Incursion into Russia**

Despite Russian reinforcements, Ukrainian troops have successfully pushed deeper into Russian territory in the Kursk region. The incursion, which began on Tuesday, has advanced 30km inside Russia, with Ukrainian forces occupying the town of Sudzha near the border. Ukrainian soldiers involved in the operation reported that they remained in Russian territory and had not been pushed back by Russian forces. **Russian officials have vowed a "tough response"** to the incursion, but the situation remains under control for Ukraine.

France used its home advantage to boost its medals tally, snagging 64 medals including 16 golds. This nearly doubled its tally from Tokyo 2020 and was better than its previous highest total in the modern Olympics era. France finished fourth overall and fifth when weighted for golds, just ahead of the Netherlands and Great Britain on that measure. The results met President Emmanuel Macron's goal to push France back into the top five after decades of languishing near the bottom of the top 10.

The head of the International Chamber of Shipping, Guy Platten, has warned that a return to protectionism under a Trump presidency would be catastrophic for global trade. **Rising US economic nationalism** threatens world trade, with shipowners particularly concerned about Trump's protectionism returning "on steroids". Platten criticized moves by the Biden-Harris administration to target Chinese shipping, saying tariffs on Chinese-built ships could drive up demand and prices for Japanese and Korean ships, ultimately costing the US more than it gains.

**Corporate travel has settled into a "new normal" with executives flying less and cutting one-day work trips by plane.**

Inflationary pressures, environmental worries, and changing attitudes to work since the pandemic have led to this shift. One-day flight trips for work "went out the door at the beginning of Covid and haven't really come back", according to Suzanne Neufang, head of the Global Business Travel Association.

Global corporate travel spending is expected to reach a record $1.48tn by the end of the year, but will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2027 due to inflation. Companies are prioritizing sustainability and reducing air travel to cut emissions.

The US men's basketball team won their fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal, defeating France 98-87 at the Paris Olympics. **LeBron James and Stephen Curry**, both NBA superstars, played together for the first time alongside Kevin Durant. Curry led the Americans with 24 points, while France was led by Victor Wembanyama with 26 points. The US team now has 17 Olympic golds in men's hoops, with James being named most valuable player of the tournament.

Royal Enfield, a retro Indian motorcycle maker, is developing its first electric bike for launch next year. The company's CEO, B Govindarajan, said the focus will be on a "gorgeous-looking" and differentiated electric vehicle that will be competitive in the market when it enters. Despite challenges in producing high-performance electric motorcycles, Royal Enfield is investing in the technology to stay competitive. **The company plans to launch its first electric model next year, with a focus on fast charging over battery-swapping.**

Viagogo, the world's largest ticket resale marketplace, is pushing for a role as an official ticket reseller for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The company believes the LA Olympics will be different from Paris, with the US being "much more commercially motivated." Viagogo's global managing director, Cris Miller, said they are in active conversations with the LA Olympics committee to provide their service and help with resale. This comes after concerns were raised about empty seats at the Paris Olympics due to a jump in tickets available for resale. **The Paris Olympics sold 9.4mn Olympic Games tickets**, but there were reports of empty seats, highlighting the need for a well-organized ticketing system.

Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has nominated former nuclear negotiator Abbas Araghchi as foreign minister, a move welcomed by Western diplomats and Iran's business community. This appointment is seen as a sign that the republic might adopt a more pragmatic approach to its long-running nuclear stand-off with the West in hopes of securing sanctions relief.

However, concerns are growing about a potential confrontation with Israel after Iranian leaders vowed to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh. The new administration faces an immediate crisis and has been criticized for not fully implementing campaign promises regarding women's rights and ethnic minority representation.

**Tensions rise in Gaza as Israel orders evacuations and death toll from school strike reaches 80**

The Israeli military has ordered tens of thousands of Palestinians to leave shelters in southern Gaza, ahead of another raid on areas from which it says Hamas fighters are operating. The move comes after a school strike killed at least 80 people, with **videos showing mangled bodies**, many of them children. Palestinian human rights groups have disputed Israel's claim that the school was being used as a Hamas command center. The death toll in Gaza is nearing **40,000**, most of whom are women and children.

Donald Trump's campaign has been hacked, with Iran blamed for the breach. The hack is alleged to be an attempt to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos in the US democratic process. A Microsoft report found Iranian hackers had broken into a high-ranking official's email account on a presidential campaign. The extent of the breach remains unclear, but internal campaign communications and a dossier on Trump's running mate were allegedly compromised. **Iranian aggression** and **US election interference** are key themes in this incident.
