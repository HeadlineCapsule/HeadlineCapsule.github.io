# Market Turmoil: What's Behind the Sell-Off?

The global market sell-off has left investors reeling, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting over 1,000 points in a single day. But what's behind this sudden downturn? In this special edition of our newsletter, we'll take a closer look at three recent articles that shed light on the current market situation.

## Federal Reserve Officials Move to Reassure Markets

Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, told CNBC that the Fed would move to "fix" any deterioration in the US economy, which he added did not appear to be in recession. Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, also chimed in, saying that officials "will do what it takes" to meet the central bank's price stability and employment goals.

## US Stocks Finish Sharply Lower to Close Out Global Market Rout

The global sell-off was exacerbated by the unwinding of the so-called yen carry trade, which had seen traders borrow in yen to buy risky assets. The sudden reversal of this trade led to a sharp decline in stocks, with Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 dropping 3% and the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite falling 3.4%.

## Market Volatility Sparks Fears of Economic Downturn

The current market volatility has sparked fears of an economic downturn, with some analysts warning that the sell-off could be a sign of things to come. However, others argue that the market is simply experiencing a correction after a long period of growth.

As we navigate this uncertain landscape, it's clear that the Federal Reserve will play a crucial role in shaping the market's direction. Will they act quickly enough to reassure investors and stem the tide of volatility? Only time will tell.

Elon Musk has filed a new lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, alleging that they broke federal civil racketeering laws and deceived him into investing in the company by promising to benefit humanity. The lawsuit claims that OpenAI's leadership "flipped the narrative" when their technology approached transformative artificial general intelligence (AGI), instead cashing in on a $10 billion investment deal with Microsoft. Musk is seeking damages and an accounting of OpenAI's gains, claiming the company was recently valued at $100 billion.

The UK government has pressed social media companies to take responsibility for amplifying misinformation and encouraging violence after riots broke out in England. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said social media platforms had "put rocket boosters" under such content, adding that the government would pursue the issue with tech giants. The Online Safety Act allows Ofcom to police tech giants, imposing fines and criminal liability for serious breaches.

The far-right violence and disruption sparked by the murder of three young girls in Southport has spread across the country, leading to over 420 arrests. Researchers have tracked millions of impressions for posts on social media platforms that stated or speculated about the attacker's identity.

Global stock markets experienced a severe sell-off on Monday, with concerns over the trajectory of the US economy and traders unwinding bets that dominated this year. The Topix index in Japan plummeted 12% - its biggest fall since the "Black Monday" crash in 1987. This was triggered by recent economic data showing a sharp slowdown in hiring, adding to fears of a US recession.

*US jobs report*: A weaker-than-expected July jobs report sparked concerns that the US economy is under growing strains from high borrowing costs.
*Fed interest rates*: The Federal Reserve held interest rates at a 23-year high above 5% last week, but investors are now pricing in four or five quarter-point reductions by the end of the year.

Markets are also reacting to the rapid rise of the yen due to the Bank of Japan's more hawkish stance. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is down about 13% from its July peak, with Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia accounting for 52% of the year-to-date returns on the S&P 500 through to the end of July.

A US federal judge ruled that Google violated antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly on search, ordering the company to pay billions of dollars in damages. The decision was seen as a "historic win" for the American people and a major blow against Big Tech's market power. Google paid tens of billions of dollars a year to maintain exclusive deals with wireless carriers, browser developers, and device manufacturers, including Apple. The ruling will enter a second phase, where the court will determine what remedies Google needs to take.

Mars, a candy, food, and petcare conglomerate, is in talks to buy Pringles maker Kellanova for $22bn. Kellanova was created in 2023 from the break-up of Kellogg's breakfast cereals and snacks businesses. The potential deal comes as consumers cut spending due to inflation. Mars has turned to acquisitions to fuel growth, including purchases of VCA and Wm Wrigley Jr. The purchase would be one of the food sector's biggest deals in years, with Kellanova's shares up 16.2% at $73.20 on Monday.

CrowdStrike has responded to Delta Air Lines' threat of litigation over a botched software update that grounded thousands of flights. CrowdStrike's lawyers argued that the airline had created a "misleading narrative" and denied responsibility for the carrier's own IT decisions. The cyber security firm claimed that any liability is contractually capped at a single-digit million amount, while Delta estimates the disruption will cost it $500mn. CrowdStrike accused Delta of public posturing about bringing a meritless lawsuit and hoped for a cooperative resolution.

Asset managers are struggling with investor reluctance to invest in the markets due to high interest rates and yields on cash savings. Investors have been holding onto $1.5tn in excess cash, missing out on potential gains of over $225bn as markets charged ahead this year. The S&P 500 is up more than 15% since the start of the year, while investors earned roughly $75bn sitting in money market funds. Rate cuts are expected to ease pressure on asset managers' bottom lines and drive investors back into the market. **Investor reluctance** has confounded managers, who thought a broad rebound in markets would bring investors back into their funds.

Twickenham Stadium, home of English rugby, will be renamed Allianz Stadium after a sponsorship deal with German insurer **Allianz**. The 82,000-capacity arena will retain its historic legacy while being redeveloped for the future. The partnership is a boost for English rugby union, which relies on Twickenham to generate income and support grassroots to professional levels. This comes as the RFU plans to redevelop the stadium amid mounting competition to host concerts. The deal solidifies **Allianz**'s presence in sports sponsorship, with existing partnerships including European football clubs Bayern Munich and Juventus.

Nvidia's next-generation AI chips, Blackwell family, are facing production challenges due to complications with certain models in mass production. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Nvidia's sole manufacturing partner, is also struggling to meet demand for advanced packaging. The issues may delay shipments planned for this year and reduce data centre revenues by up to 15%. However, analysts expect the mid- to long-term story for Nvidia or AI adoption to remain unchanged. **[Nvidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia)**'s stock fell 6% after the news, while TSMC closed down 10%.

OpenAI co-founder John Schulman has left the company to join rival Anthropic, a start-up focused on AI safety. This departure follows that of other senior figures, including Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, who have also joined Anthropic. Schulman's move is due to his desire for deeper focus on AI alignment research, which he says was not a factor in leaving OpenAI. OpenAI's president Greg Brockman has announced a sabbatical, citing the need for relaxation since co-founding the company 9 years ago.

**Important Keywords:** OpenAI, John Schulman, Anthropic, AI safety, AI alignment, Ilya Sutskever, Jan Leike

Adani Group's power transmission arm, Adani Energy Solutions (AESL), has raised $1bn in an equity sale, exceeding the base deal size six times over. The funds will be used to pay down debt and invest in smart metering business. Major buyers included INQ, Citigroup, Nomura, and SBI mutual fund. This is a significant move for Adani Group after being hit by corporate fraud allegations last year. AESL operates and constructs over 21,000 km of power lines, playing a pivotal role in India's energy transition.

The liquidators of China Evergrande have launched a court effort in Hong Kong to recover $6bn from its founder Hui Ka Yan and other top executives. The claim is based on allegedly "misstated" financial statements made by the Hong Kong-listed company for 2017-2020. The proceedings aim to recover funds including dividends and remuneration from Hui, former CEO Xia Haijun, CFO Pan Darong, and four other individuals and entities. Many of Hui's assets in Hong Kong have already been seized or sold, but the outcome is uncertain.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has sacked nine staff members suspected of being involved in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. The decision follows an internal investigation by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, which found insufficient evidence to suggest other employees were involved. The US and others had suspended funding to UNRWA due to allegations of militant activity among staff members. UNRWA condemned the attack and reiterated its commitment to providing humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza. **UNRWA**, **Hamas**, **Israel**, **Gaza**

**Israel-Hamas Conflict: Netanyahu Clashes with Security Chiefs**

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is at odds with his security chiefs over a potential agreement to halt fighting in Gaza. The dispute comes as Israel braces for retaliation from Iran and its proxy forces. Defence officials, including the head of the IDF, support a deal, but Netanyahu has hardened Israel's position, putting talks at risk. A ceasefire could open the window for an agreement to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. However, Netanyahu's stance is influenced by domestic politics, with far-right ministers threatening to topple his coalition if he accepts a halt to fighting.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that Tehran would "definitely" respond to Israel for the assassination of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh. The killing was a "violation of Iran's territorial integrity" and "clearly cannot remain unanswered". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged all parties to refrain from escalation and take steps to ease tensions. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the killing, but both Iran and Hamas blamed Israel. The situation is escalating with the US sending military reinforcements to the Mediterranean and holding talks with regional leaders to ease tensions.
