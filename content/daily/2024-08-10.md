# Tech Tensions Escalate: Trade Wars, AI Showdowns, and Electric Dreams
The world of technology is abuzz with tensions running high on multiple fronts. From trade wars to AI showdowns, the stakes are higher than ever before. In this edition of our newsletter, we'll delve into three articles that capture the essence of these escalating tensions.

## China Challenges EU Tariffs on Electric Vehicles
China has fired back at the European Union's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle exporters, filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO). The move is seen as an escalation of the trade dispute between Brussels and Beijing. The EU had imposed provisional tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles following an investigation that found China was unfairly subsidizing its car industry.

## Hedge Funds Pile into US Tech Stocks Amid AI-Driven Sell-Off
Hedge funds have made their biggest one-day buying move in five months, pouring money into US tech stocks amid a sell-off driven by concerns over artificial intelligence (AI). The move comes as analysts predict opportunities in the tech space, particularly among large-cap companies. Ben Powell, chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, said he was "looking for opportunities in the tech space."

## Perplexity AI Takes on Google with $250mn Funding Boost
Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence search start-up, has raised $250 million in funding to take on Google. The company's monthly revenues and usage have surged seven-fold since the start of the year, with its AI-powered search engine answering over 250 million questions last month. Perplexity plans to use the funding to pivot its business model from subscriptions to advertising, bringing it into closer competition with Google.

**Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has blocked access to X (formerly Twitter) for 10 days, amid a public dispute with Elon Musk and a clampdown on dissent over his disputed re-election.**
Maduro accused Musk of promoting protests triggered by the election, painting the billionaire as part of a US-backed "fascist, imperialist" coup attempt in Venezuela.
**Musk has been trading insults with Maduro since the polls, calling him a "clown" and a "dictator."**
The move comes amid a nationwide furore over Maduro's disputed re-election, with the opposition claiming their candidate won by a significant margin.

Catalan separatist leader **Carles Puigdemont** has fled Spain after evading arrest by Spanish authorities in Barcelona. He claims he is in Belgium and refuses to surrender due to the "unacceptable" persecution for political reasons. His party, Junts per Catalunya, threatens to review its support for Spain's coalition government. The move comes after a controversial amnesty deal was struck with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez in exchange for their parliamentary support. Puigdemont argues that the Supreme Court judges are "obsessed" with having him in custody.

**Bangladesh Students Take Charge After Ousting Sheikh Hasina**
Students have taken charge of Bangladesh's megacity, Dhaka, after ousting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. **Over 230 people have been killed** since her regime collapsed and the country is facing an alarming breakdown in law and order. A new interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus has promised to reform institutions and end corruption. However, experts warn that elections must be held within 90 days, which could lead to a potential stand-off between the interim government and the BNP, a likely favorite to win. The students' self-styled revolution aims to rebuild the nation, but faces enormous challenges in implementing their lofty vision.

**US Drug Regulators Reject Ecstasy as Mental Health Treatment**

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has rejected a bid to approve ecstasy (MDMA) as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The FDA cited concerns over the way clinical trials were conducted, including struggles with double-blinding and potential cardiovascular risks. A panel of outside experts voted overwhelmingly against approving the treatment, citing significant limitations in the data. Lykos Therapeutics, the biotech behind the treatment, will need to carry out costly fresh phase-three trials, putting its decades-long efforts to get MDMA approved as a PTSD treatment in peril. **About 13mn Americans suffer from PTSD**.

Chocolate prices are rising globally due to record-high cocoa futures, with Freddo frog prices doubling in Australia and UK to £1. **Cocoa futures have reached record highs of $12,000 a ton** as poor weather and disease devastated crops in Ghana and Ivory Coast, where two-thirds of the world's cocoa beans are grown. Chocolate makers like Mondelez, Nestlé, Lindt, and Hershey have been passing on increased costs to consumers, leading to decreased sales. However, with better weather forecasted in West Africa, hopes for a rebound in supply are rising, causing prices to tumble.

Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund ADQ is investing $1bn in Sotheby's, a minority stake via newly issued shares. The cash will be used to reduce leverage and support the company's growth plans. Patrick Drahi, Sotheby's majority owner, is also putting in additional money. The investment represents a change of position for Drahi, who previously said he did not need to sell or bring in outside investors. ADQ's involvement reflects the growing presence of Gulf state buyers in the art market.

Market turmoil was exacerbated by summer holidays, as senior investors scrambled to respond from their holiday homes and junior traders struggled to keep up with the unfolding chaos. A lack of liquidity made market ructions worse, according to Dan Scott, head of multi-asset boutique at Vontobel. **"If everyone's away for the summer and you don't have enough liquidity when something like that happens, you've got a big problem."** The August slump is a familiar phenomenon in finance, with skeleton staffing and illiquidity bringing greater volatility.

Coca-Cola has raised €1bn in new debt, which may be used to help pay potential charges arising from a decade-long dispute with US tax authorities. The company could owe $16bn in back taxes for manufacturing processes in countries like Ireland and Brazil. This amount would wipe out a year and a half of profits. Coca-Cola also plans to use the funds to pay its final payment on the purchase of Fairlife, an ultra-filtered milk drinks producer. **US companies have raised €30bn through so-called reverse Yankee deals this year**.

RedBird IMI is whittling down a shortlist of potential buyers for the Telegraph newspaper, with Mediahuis expected to fall out of the auction. Other bidders, including Lord Maurice Saatchi, have also failed to meet the valuation set by RedBird IMI. Despite this, executives at RedBird IMI are confident they will cover their costs and potentially make a profit on the deal. The sale process is expected to continue into September, with a separate deal to sell the UK's Spectator magazine proceeding quickly. **RedBird IMI wants to recoup its money from its blocked £600mn takeover of the Telegraph and Spectator magazine.**

India's e-scooter maker Ola Electric made a successful market debut, with shares jumping 20% on its listing day. The company raised $655mn through an IPO, backed by investors like Nomura and Franklin Templeton. Despite a globally volatile week for equities, the anchor investments were impressive, drawing bids 4.3 times above the number of shares offered. Ola Electric plans to use the funds to invest in a battery factory, pay down debts, and fund research and development. The company has been aggressive in scaling up its market share, but faces challenges in the EV industry. **Its valuation remains rich at $4bn**, with some analysts skeptical of its prospects given continued losses.

The US has accused Israeli far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich of "misleading" the public with his comments on a proposed Gaza ceasefire deal. Smotrich said it's not time for a deal that ends the war before eliminating Hamas, but **US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby** called him "dead wrong". The US is frustrated with Israel's refusal to accept the proposed deal and has directed military resources to the Middle East to defend against potential Iranian attacks.

Imane Khelif, a 25-year-old Algerian boxer, has been crowned Olympic champion after winning her gold-medal bout on Friday night in Paris. Her victory comes amid an international row over gender eligibility rules. Khelif was at the heart of a controversy when she and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting were disqualified from last year's world championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA) due to "gender eligibility" criteria. The IOC intervened, giving them the green light to compete in Paris, saying the IBA tests had been "cobbled together overnight". **Khelif won her bout against China's Yang Liu by unanimous decision**.

Denmark is strengthening its border controls with Sweden after a surge in shootings involving Swedish teenagers in Copenhagen. Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard cited 25 incidents since April where Danish gangs hired "child soldiers" to commit crimes, including three shootings linked to Swedish teens. The phenomenon has been described as "scary" and officials warn that powerful criminal gangs are using children to carry out murders due to lenient sentences. Denmark is tightening its intelligence co-operation with Sweden and exploring facial recognition technology to combat the issue.

The UK Serious Fraud Office is charging two more people in connection with its investigation into Glencore's oil trading division in Africa. This is part of a long-running probe into alleged bribery by the company's London-based West Africa desk. The SFO has already charged five former Glencore executives, including billionaire ex-head of oil Alex Beard, with conspiring to make corrupt payments between 2007 and 2014. **The new charges are against individuals who are currently outside the jurisdiction**, meaning they reside outside the UK.

Microsoft has warned that Iranian state-backed actors are increasing cyber attacks and disinformation efforts ahead of the US election. A group linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards attempted to access email accounts of senior US political figures, including a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign. Additionally, "covert news sites" were launched to target US voters with AI-generated content that plagiarized from US outlets. Microsoft expects Iranian cyber attacks to escalate and create chaos, undermine authorities, and sow doubt about the election's integrity.
