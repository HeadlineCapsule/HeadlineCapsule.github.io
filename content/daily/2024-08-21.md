# Global Markets Shift Amidst Tariffs and Dollar Weakness 


# Navigating Shifting Markets: A Look at Global Economics

This week's headlines are dominated by a confluence of global economic trends, from trade tensions to currency fluctuations. We delve into the EU's decision on tariffs for Tesla imports, analyze the dollar's recent decline against a backdrop of potential rate cuts, and explore the evolving landscape of global markets.

## The Price of Electrification: EU Tariffs Target Tesla Imports

The European Union has decided to impose a 19% tariff on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lower than the initial proposed rate but still sparking debate.  Brussels argues that Tesla benefits from Chinese government subsidies, while Tesla and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU maintain that competitiveness stems from factors like industrial scale and market competition. This move underscores growing tensions between the EU and China over trade practices and the race for dominance in the electric vehicle market. 

"The competitiveness of electric vehicles made in China is not driven by subsidies but by factors such as industrial scale, comprehensive supply chain advantages and intense market competition," stated the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU.

## Dollar Dip: Anticipation Grows Ahead of Fed Decision

The US dollar has reached its lowest point since the beginning of the year, driven by expectations of upcoming interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This decline comes after a strong performance in the first half of 2023, fueled by the resilience of the US economy. Investors are now eagerly awaiting Fed Chair Jay Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium this week for clues about the future direction of monetary policy.

"The market is looking for a soft landing and Fed rate cuts . . . which is negative for the dollar," said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America.


##  Unwinding Carry Trades: Yen Strengthens as Dollar Weakens

The recent decline in the US dollar has been further amplified by an unwinding of "carry trades", where investors borrowed yen to invest in higher-yielding US dollars. This shift has led to a surge in the value of the Japanese yen, which gained over 7% against the greenback in the past month. The move highlights the changing dynamics in global currency markets as investors adjust their positions amidst evolving economic conditions and central bank policies.

"Positioning on the dollar has moved to flat but is nowhere near extended — now the question for the rest of the year is: do you want to go short the dollar?" said Chris Turner, head of research at ING.

**Barack Obama warns Democrats of 'tight race' to defeat Donald Trump**

Former US President Barack Obama delivered a rousing speech at the Democratic National Convention, urging party supporters to unite behind presidential candidate Kamala Harris and warning that the election would be a "tight race" in a closely divided country. Obama mocked Trump as a "whining" self-interested billionaire and conspiracy theorist whose act had gone "pretty stale." Michelle Obama also spoke, calling out Trump for his limited view of the world and urging action from fellow Democrats. Harris is leading Trump by almost 3 percentage points nationally, according to polling averages.

A rocket engine exploded at Britain's new spaceport in Shetland during a test by German start-up Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA). The scheduled nine-engine test was part of several trials before progressing to launch. **No one was injured** and the launch pad was secured, but the incident was described as an "anomaly" leading to the "loss of the stage". RFA aims to return to regular operations as soon as possible. The spaceport hopes to launch 30 rockets per year, with a focus on cost-effective and flexible services for satellite launches.

A US judge has blocked the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) ban on non-compete agreements, citing a lack of authority from Congress. The ruling affects about 30mn workers in the US, who are bound by clauses preventing them from working for competitors or launching competing businesses. The FTC had argued that the rule would increase competition and help workers, but business groups contended it was an overreach of authority. **The decision means the FTC's ban on non-competes will not take effect as scheduled**.

BT has suffered a blow as Sky chose rival network provider CityFibre as its second broadband partner, dealing a significant loss of customers and market share. **Sky will use CityFibre's network in areas where Openreach is not present**, with new customers expected to be on the CityFibre network while existing over 6.5 million subscribers remain on Openreach. This deal is seen as a major coup for CityFibre, which has already passed 3.8mn premises and aims to reach 8mn in the coming years.

The US will support a global treaty aiming to reduce plastic production, marking a policy shift as countries work towards a final agreement to curb pollution. The fresh backing from the US, one of the world's largest producers, boosts prospects for the UN unveiling a landmark treaty by the end of this year. Scientists report further disturbing evidence about the harmful effects of plastics, including links to adverse health outcomes. **The US produces the most plastic waste per capita**, with the average American responsible for about 130kg of plastic waste a year.

CrowdStrike's president hit out at rivals' "shady" attacks after a global IT outage caused by a botched software update. The company's CEO, Michael Sentonas, said no vendor can guarantee their software will never cause a similar incident. Rivals like SentinelOne and Trellix have used the outage to promote their own products, but Sentonas called this "misguided". CrowdStrike has promised to introduce new checks and staggered updates to prevent a repeat of the mass disruption. The company's market value has shed almost a quarter since the incident.

**Qatar Airways Acquires Stake in Airlink, Eyes More Deals**

Qatar Airways has acquired a 25% stake in South Africa's Airlink, expanding its operations on the African continent. This move comes as part of an effort to increase access to passengers from regional cities in Africa and funnel more traffic through its Doha hub. The airline's CEO signaled that it is open to investing in other airlines if there is potential for collaboration. The deal represents a significant investment in Airlink, with the airline carrying over 3mn passengers every year to destinations in 15 sub-Saharan African countries.

Canadian railways, Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Kansas City, are on the verge of a strike with 9,300 workers threatening to stop work as soon as Thursday. **The strike would be devastating for the North American economy**, disrupting industries like agriculture, construction, meat processing, and car manufacturing. The US Chamber of Commerce and Canadian Chamber of Commerce have called on Ottawa to intervene to avert a disruption. **A prolonged shutdown would have significant cascading effects** on supply chains across the continent.

Hamas has denied backing off from Gaza ceasefire talks, accusing the US of being biased towards Israel. The Palestinian militant group rejected President Joe Biden's claim that they were "backing off" from a deal, which the US and Arab states see as the best way to avoid a regional war in the Middle East. A bridging proposal, aimed at resolving outstanding points of dispute between Israel and Hamas, has been put forward by mediators, but crucial details remain to be finalised. **Key sticking points include Israel's presence on the border between Egypt and Gaza and the terms for releasing Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages**.

Iran is facing a severe shortage of life-saving medicines due to economic sanctions. The Iranian Thalassaemia Society reports that 1,100 patients have died since 2018 due to lack of access to drugs. Sanctions have increased costs and risks for patients, with many foreign suppliers refusing to deal with Iran. **200+ medicines are in short supply**, including treatments for cancer, immunodeficiency disorders, and mental illnesses. The new president has pledged to tackle the issue, but patients and doctors blame both sanctions and domestic mismanagement for the crisis.

Mexico's federal judges will strike on Wednesday to protest President López Obrador's plan to fire them and elect replacements via popular vote. The president aims to overhaul the judiciary, replacing all federal judges, including supreme court justices. This move has been met with opposition from Mexico's legal community and international experts, who claim it threatens judicial independence and rule of law. **The strike is an attempt to pause the reform process**, which López Obrador claims will bring judges closer to the people. The president's plan is part of a larger package of constitutional changes aimed at cementing his legacy.

Protesters clashed with police outside the Israeli consulate in Chicago, leading to arrests, during a convention where Democrats were nominating Kamala Harris for president. The protest was against US President Joe Biden's support for Israel in the Gaza war. Demonstrators wore keffiyehs and burned Israeli flags, while counter-protesters waved Israeli flags, sparking running scuffles. **The city has been bracing for protests since Chicago was named host city for the convention nearly a year ago**. The protest was organized by the leftist group Behind Enemy Lines.

**Jonathan Bloomer: Missing City Executive**

Jonathan Bloomer, a 70-year-old accountant and insurance executive, is missing after a luxury yacht sank off the coast of Sicily. He was a key witness in Mike Lynch's trial, where Lynch was acquitted of fraud over the sale of Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard for $11bn in 2011. Bloomer had a long career, including time as CEO of Prudential, and was named to Autonomy's board as a non-executive director in 2010. He was last seen on Lynch's yacht celebrating his acquittal.
