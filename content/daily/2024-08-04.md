# Market Turmoil: A Week of Wild Swings
The past week has been a rollercoaster ride for investors, with market volatility reaching new heights. From the US jobs report to Warren Buffett's investment moves, and a global stock sell-off, it's been a wild ride.

## Democratic Party's "Trump is Weird" Strategy Rattles Republicans
Kamala Harris has launched a novel attack on Donald Trump, describing him as "weird". This move has unnerved Republicans and highlighted the hardline views of Trump's running mate. According to Travis Helwig, creator of an ad called "these guys are just weird", this strategy is resonating with voters because while Trump enjoys being called a threat to democracy, "weird" is getting under his skin.

## Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Halves Stake in Apple
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has slashed its stake in Apple by more than $50bn, generating huge investment profits. This move has lifted Berkshire's cash holdings to a record high of $277bn. According to Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at J Stern & Co, this sale is a sign that Buffett is exercising his valuation discipline.

## Global Stock Sell-Off Deepens After Disappointing US Jobs Data
A global stock sell-off has deepened after the US jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring. This has sparked fears that the Federal Reserve may fall behind the curve in combating a slowing economy. The Nasdaq Composite index closed 2.4% lower, and the S&P 500 ended 1.8% lower. According to Steven Blitz, chief US economist at TS Lombard, "The Fed rolled the dice one more time on Wednesday and they've been proved wrong."

The US has rejected Vietnam's bid for "market economy" status, a move that will hinder trade ties between the two countries. Vietnam had sought the upgrade due to its growing importance as a manufacturing alternative to China. The US commerce department cited extensive government involvement in Vietnam's economy as the reason for rejecting the request. This decision is seen as a blow to Hanoi's diplomatic efforts and may disappoint the country, which had hoped to deepen trade ties with its most important export market, the US. **Market economy status** was denied due to **government intervention** in the Vietnamese economy.

Abrdn's finance chief Jason Windsor is likely to replace Stephen Bird as CEO following his departure after a problematic rebrand and expulsion from the FTSE 100. Two sources close to the process told the Financial Times that Windsor, who joined Abrdn in October as CFO, was the favoured candidate. The next CEO will take on the role after a turbulent four years for Abrdn, marked by outflows from equity funds and competition from index trackers. **Abrdn's new CEO** will face pressure to reduce costs and reset strategy.

A brain implant made from graphene is set to begin a clinical trial in Manchester, UK. The implant has 64 graphene electrodes that will stimulate and read neural activity with high precision. The trial aims to demonstrate the safety of graphene electrodes applied to the brain in eight to ten patients. The implant's potential applications include better treatments for neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and stroke. Graphene is considered a "wonder material" due to its electrical and mechanical properties, and researchers are confident that it will offer advantages over metal electrodes used in other brain computer interfaces.

The UK mid-cap FTSE 250 index has outperformed the blue-chip FTSE 100 index this month, gaining 3.2% compared to a 0.2% rise. This is due in part to a rally in housebuilders and infrastructure stocks, which are seen as closely tracking the strength of the UK economy. Investors are hopeful that the performance of the UK economy will keep international investors enthusiastic for UK stocks despite fears of a global recession. A rate cut by the Bank of England could also boost the trend further. **Mid-cap stocks**, such as housebuilders and infrastructure companies, are benefiting from this trend.

Bolt, Uber's European rival, has offered UK drivers holiday pay and a minimum wage guarantee ahead of a court hearing on their employment status. Despite maintaining that drivers are self-employed independent contractors, the company's new terms grant them benefits similar to those afforded to workers under UK law. This move comes as gig economy companies face growing pressure to improve pay and conditions for drivers and couriers. The GMB union will continue pressing its claims in court, seeking drivers' rights to hourly minimum wage and holiday pay.

**Key Entities:** Bolt, Uber, UK drivers, GMB union, employment status, minimum wage, holiday pay

Iran blames Israel for killing Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in a "short-range projectile" attack on his residence in Tehran. The Revolutionary Guards vowed to "punish" Israel and accused the US of complicity. Haniyeh, who had met Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei days before, died along with his bodyguard. The attack has stoked fears of a full-blown war in the Middle East. Iran promised a "severe punishment" to Israel and vowed to "avenge the blood" of Haniyeh. Tensions are high between Iran and Israel, with both sides exchanging fire. **Israel**, **Iran**, **Hamas**
