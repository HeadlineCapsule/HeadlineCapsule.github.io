# Global Trade Tensions Surge Amid Tariff Wars and Supply Chain Fears 


## Global Trade Tensions Escalate as US Allies Follow Suit

This week, global trade tensions have ratcheted up a notch with Canada joining the United States and the European Union in imposing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.  Simultaneously, concerns are mounting over China's export controls on crucial semiconductor materials, potentially disrupting supply chains for advanced chips and military hardware worldwide. Finally, IBM's decision to significantly downsize its research and development operations in China underscores a broader trend of US companies retreating from the world's second-largest economy.

## Canada Targets Chinese EVs and Steel with Steep Tariffs

In a move mirroring recent US actions, Canada announced it will impose 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and 25 percent levies on steel and aluminum imports. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited "unfair practices" by China in justifying the decision, stating that Beijing has chosen to "give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace." The tariffs, effective from October 1st, aim to protect Canadian workers and industries while leveling the playing field with key trading partners.

## China's Export Controls on Semiconductor Materials Fuel Supply Chain Fears


China's export restrictions on germanium and gallium, essential components for semiconductor applications and military hardware, are raising alarm bells among western manufacturers.  Prices for these crucial minerals have nearly doubled in Europe over the past year as shipments from China dwindle. Analysts suggest Beijing is leveraging its dominance in global supply chains to retaliate against US-led restrictions on Chinese access to cutting-edge technologies.

## IBM Shrinks Research Footprint in China Amid Growing Tensions


American tech giant IBM is scaling back its research and development operations in China, eliminating over 1,000 jobs across several offices. This move follows a broader trend of US companies reducing their exposure to the Chinese market amid escalating geopolitical tensions.  IBM executives cited shrinking infrastructure business and increasing competition as factors driving the decision. While some employees are being offered relocation opportunities, others face severance packages. The closure underscores the complexities and risks facing multinational corporations operating in a rapidly evolving global landscape.

**Emmanuel Macron has denied claims that the arrest of Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov is politically motivated, saying it was part of an ongoing judicial investigation. French prosecutors detained Durov as part of an investigation into Telegram's moderation of alleged criminal activity on the platform. The allegations include child sex crimes, drug trafficking, and money laundering. Durov fled Russia in 2014 after allegedly refusing to comply with Moscow's demands for access to Ukrainian users' data.**

Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine resulted in at least five deaths and 30 injuries. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia launched 127 missiles and 109 drones, targeting cities and critical infrastructure across the country. The energy sector was a primary target, with several power plants and hydroelectric facilities damaged or destroyed. Ukrainian authorities reported explosions in over 15 regions, including civilian deaths in Lutsk and Dnipro. The attacks led to rolling blackouts and emergency shutdowns of power supply in several areas. **The international community is being urged to condemn the aggression and take tangible action**.

ExxonMobil has forecasted that global oil demand will remain virtually unchanged by 2050, contradicting other major oil companies such as BP and the International Energy Agency. Exxon warned of a new energy price shock if companies fail to invest in fossil fuels to meet this demand, which could quadruple crude prices. The Texas oil company's prediction assumes an energy transition will fail to curb the world's thirst for fossil fuels. This forecast comes amid a debate between fossil fuel producers and policymakers who warn of dangerous global warming unless consumers rapidly curb burning of fossil fuels.

Mark Zuckerberg accused the Biden administration of pressuring Meta to "censor" certain Covid-19 content during the pandemic. In a letter, Zuckerberg wrote that senior officials repeatedly pressured Meta's team to censor humor and satire related to Covid-19. He stated that he believed government pressure was wrong and regretted not being more outspoken about it.

Zuckerberg also announced that he will not contribute to electoral infrastructure this election cycle, citing the interpretation of past donations as benefiting one party over the other. The White House responded by stating that they encouraged responsible actions during the pandemic and believe tech companies should consider public health effects.

**French President Emmanuel Macron has ruled out a leftwing alliance forming France's next government**, stating that over 350 deputies would oppose the Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) in the National Assembly, preventing it from governing. Macron is seeking to form a coalition of moderate "republican forces" ranging from the centre-left to the right, excluding the far-left La France Insoumise (LFI) and the far-right Rassemblement National. The NFP had won July's snap parliamentary election but fell short of a majority. Macron has appointed a caretaker prime minister, and pressure is mounting to install the next government ahead of October's budget vote.

The top central bankers at the Jackson Hole symposium are hopeful they can achieve a soft landing for the global economy after experiencing the worst inflation shock in four decades. **Andrew Bailey and Jay Powell signaled that they will cut borrowing costs while still avoiding a recession**. Economists echoed their optimism, citing continued low unemployment and strength. Central banks have lowered interest rates this summer and are expected to reduce them further, with the Fed set to join them in September. The pivot from central banks is seen as the "right" move, potentially stabilizing activity and benefiting emerging market economies.

Banks, insurers, and accounting firms are being warned by UK unions to prepare for the cost of retraining millions of employees whose jobs could be displaced by artificial intelligence (AI). A report from Citigroup warns that half of banking jobs are at risk from automation. The Trades Union Congress will debate motions calling on financial services groups to fund a major programme to reskill staff and regulate employers' use of AI. Unions also want legislation to protect workers from AI-generated unemployment, inequality, and prejudice.

UK shop prices have fallen for the first time in almost three years, entering deflation. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) reported an annual price fall of 0.3% in August, with non-food costs declining by 1.5%. This trend is driven by retailers discounting summer stock due to poor sales and bad weather. Households will benefit from lower prices, particularly for fashion and household goods. The BRC's figures suggest that food price inflation will continue to ease, following a 45-year high in March 2023. **Food prices have risen sharply since the Ukraine invasion**.

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado says President Nicolás Maduro's crackdown on protests after his disputed election victory is unsustainable. **Maduro has arrested over 1,500 people and killed 24** in relation to demonstrations, while Machado's candidate Edmundo González was declared the real winner by the opposition. Despite US sanctions and international pressure, Maduro remains in power, with the supreme court recently ratifying his victory. The opposition is pursuing a strategy of scheduled protests and foreign diplomacy to weaken Maduro's support and force a negotiated settlement.

Mexico's incoming president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has chosen academic Víctor Rodríguez to run Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the country's heavily indebted state oil company. Pemex has a debt pile of about $100bn and production has been falling for two decades. **Sheinbaum aims to rescue Pemex and increase refining capacity**, but investors are unclear how she will balance this with shifting to renewables and attracting investment. Rodríguez, an energy economics specialist, has promised to work closely with the finance ministry and private sector to coordinate investments.

Apple's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, will step down at the end of 2024 after over a decade in the role. He will be succeeded by Kevan Parekh, Apple's vice-president for financial planning and analysis. Maestri has been a key member of Apple's top leadership team and has overseen significant financial growth during his tenure, including a $3tn market cap and billions of dollars in cash on hand. Maestri praised Apple's consistency under his management, while analysts note that any change creates some level of uncertainty.

Several British business groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses, and Institute of Directors, have called on Ofcom to establish an automatic compensation scheme for companies affected by broadband outages. They argue that improved network resilience would **boost economic growth and productivity**. Research shows 51% of UK fixed business connectivity customers experienced at least one outage in the past year, with no compensation received. Some telecoms groups already provide compensation, but formal regulation only applies to small businesses using residential services.

The World Meteorological Organization has warned that sea level rise, ocean warming, and acidification are threatening Pacific Islands. The region is experiencing faster-than-average sea surface temperature rises, with marine heatwaves doubling in frequency since 1980. Despite contributing only 0.02% of global emissions, the Pacific Islands face severe climate change consequences. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called on global leaders to drastically reduce emissions and invest in climate adaptation measures. The region is also struggling to finance a proposed Pacific Resilience Facility and a new loss and damage fund to address climate change.

A fatal knife attack in Solingen, Germany has placed immigration and Islamist terrorism at the top of the political agenda ahead of elections next Sunday. The nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has seized on the incident to hammer home its anti-foreigner message. **Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised to tighten Germany's laws on weapons, reduce irregular migrant inflow, and increase deportations**. However, others cautioned against a knee-jerk response, emphasizing the need to balance immigration policies with security concerns. The AfD is expected to make strong gains in elections, fueled by anti-foreigner sentiment.
