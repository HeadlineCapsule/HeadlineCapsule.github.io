# Market Volatility Returns: What You Need to Know
Global financial markets have been shaken out of their calm, with a surge in market volatility sparking concerns among investors. In this special edition, we curate three articles that provide insight into the current state of the markets and what it means for investors.

## China Imposes Restrictions on Fentanyl Chemicals
China has announced plans to impose controls on the production of critical chemicals used in the manufacture of fentanyl, a move seen as a significant step forward in the country's efforts to crack down on the deadly synthetic opioid. The White House has welcomed the decision, which follows a meeting between senior US and Chinese officials in Washington last week. According to Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, "China has always attached great importance to international counter-narcotics co-operation and is willing to co-operate with countries worldwide including the United States."

## PwC Faces Lawsuit Over Auditing of Evergrande
Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is facing a lawsuit over its auditing of Chinese property developer Evergrande, which has been accused of inflating revenues by $78 billion. The lawsuit, filed by liquidators of Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed unit, alleges that PwC failed to detect the accounting irregularities and ignored red flags. The case is seen as a test of the big four accounting firms' auditing standards in China.

## Investors Brace for 'Regime Shift' as Market Volatility Returns
Investors are bracing for more market volatility after a surge in the Vix index, which measures expected stock price swings, to its highest level since 2020. The move has sparked concerns that the period of calm in global financial markets is over and that investors need to be prepared for a new era of higher volatility. According to Ajay Rajadhyaksha, global chair of research at Barclays, "This is a regime shift... I find it very hard to believe that you're going to go back to business as usual."

Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the US presidential election. Harris believes Walz's convictions on fighting for middle-class families will appeal to working-class voters in swing states. Walz, a veteran and former football coach, was selected ahead of other top contenders, including Senator Mark Kelly and Governor Josh Shapiro. He is seen as having the potential to attract moderate, working-class, and rural voters who could put Harris over the top in battleground states.

*Important keywords:* Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, US presidential election, running mate, Democratic ticket

Kamala Harris introduced her running mate, Minnesota governor Tim Walz, at a Democratic party rally in Philadelphia. Harris presented Walz as a champion of personal freedoms, contrasting with Donald Trump's policies. Walz emphasized the importance of unity and compromise, and the need to defend abortion rights and safety from gun violence. Harris and Walz appealed to both progressive and moderate wings of the party, framing themselves as defenders of American values. The event marked a shift in Democratic messaging, focusing on personal freedoms rather than democracy.

Global stock markets staged a partial rebound on Tuesday, following sharp sell-offs in previous days. The US S&P 500 index closed 1% higher, after losing 3% on Monday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also rose 1%. The Vix index, which measures investor expectations of market swings, fell from 38.6 to 27.7. Japanese stocks surged, with the Topix index rising 9.3%, driven by a rebound in Tokyo's stock market after an unexpected Bank of Japan rate rise. **Asian and European markets also posted modest gains**. The rally was attributed to reduced concerns about US economic risks and geopolitical tensions.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been named head of Bangladesh's interim government after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country amidst a popular uprising. The 84-year-old Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, was appointed by President Mohammed Shahabuddin to lead an interim cabinet until a new election is held. This comes as protests over an unpopular job quota scheme have turned into a youth-led movement demanding Sheikh Hasina's resignation, with at least 135 people killed in the crackdown.

The US has warned Turkey that there will be consequences if it does not curtail its exports of US military-linked hardware to Russia. Turkish officials were met with this message by Matthew Axelrod, assistant commerce secretary, in Ankara and Istanbul. The US is concerned about the illicit trade of western-made electronics, including processors and amplifiers, being sent to Russian missiles and drones. Turkey's trade ministry has declined to comment on the allegations. The US Treasury has sanctioned numerous Turkish companies for allegedly supplying Russia's military-industrial complex. **US-Turkey relations**, **export controls**, **Russia-Ukraine war** are key entities in this story.

Uber's consumer spending remained strong in the second quarter, with revenue rising 16% year on year to $10.7bn. The company's delivery segment saw "healthy" order growth in the US, while its ride-hailing business was less affected by a weakening economy. Uber's net income reached $1bn, beating market expectations. The company expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax (ebit) to be between $1.58bn and $1.68bn in the current period. **Revenue growth** and **profitability** were key highlights of the quarter.

Australian hedge fund star Greg Coffey's firm, Kirkoswald Capital, has made hundreds of millions of dollars in recent market turmoil.

Airbnb has warned that cautious US consumers will impact sales in its peak summer season, with revenue expected to be between $3.67bn and $3.73bn, below analyst expectations of $3.84bn. This marks a deceleration in year-on-year sales growth to 8-10%, compared to 11% in the previous quarter. The company has also announced plans to expand beyond accommodation services, including a new "co-hosting marketplace" and products that will support top events globally.

**Key figures:**

* Revenue: $3.67bn - $3.73bn (vs analyst expectations of $3.84bn)

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Wall Street banks, including Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, over allegations of systematically cheating customers out of billions of dollars in interest payments on "cash sweep" accounts. The probe focuses on whether the groups steered clients into low-interest accounts and if financial advisers had a fiduciary duty to advise clients on higher returns. Lawsuits have been filed against multiple firms, including LPL Financial and Ameriprise, alleging that they prioritized their bottom lines over client interests. **SEC investigation**, **Wall Street banks**, **cash sweep accounts**.

Warner Bros Discovery's management is looking to avoid a break-up of the company by selling smaller assets such as TVN, a Polish broadcaster, or a stake in Warner's video games business. The company's stock price has fallen by almost 70% since its formation in 2022. Despite considering a split, executives have determined that it would create significant operational challenges and trigger lawsuits from debt investors. Instead, CEO David Zaslav and CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels are looking to offload smaller assets and convince investors to remain patient as they work to turn around the company.

Apple's partnership with Google is facing challenges after a landmark antitrust ruling against Google. The case involves exclusive agreements between Google and various companies, including Apple, which has benefited from a $20bn revenue-sharing deal.

Global financial markets are experiencing a turbulent summer, with equity indices in the US and Japan plummeting before staging a partial rebound. The recent market jitters were sparked by weak US jobs data and exacerbated by the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike, which led to a sharp sell-off in Tokyo's stock market **(-12.2% on Monday)**. Big Tech stocks, including the "Magnificent Seven," also suffered significant losses, wiping out $1tn from their market capitalization in two days. Market volatility surged to its highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic, with the Vix index reaching a record high.

Cori Bush, a leftwing representative from Missouri, has become the second member of the Democratic party's progressive "Squad" to be ousted by a mainstream primary challenger this year. She lost to Wesley Bell, a local prosecutor backed by millions of dollars in support from the conservative pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC. This defeat comes a month after New York's Jamaal Bowman fell to a Democratic primary challenger. The two races showcase divisions within the party between establishment and progressive factions led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Advertising group WPP is nearing a deal to sell its controlling stake in financial communications company FGS Global to private equity group KKR for about $800mn. This will give KKR an 80% stake in the business, valued at around $1.6bn. The deal would be a boost to WPP's finances and revive talk about whether its share price reflects the value of its various businesses. FGS Global has close to 30 offices worldwide and generated $450mn in revenue last year.

**Important Entities:** WPP, KKR, FGS Global

If convicted, Kim will be forced to relinquish control of the country's biggest internet bank, potentially weakening Kakao's fintech and AI ambitions.

Seven US personnel were wounded in a rocket attack by Iran-backed militias on a base in Iraq, underscoring the threat to American forces amid intensified diplomatic efforts to ease tensions between Iran and Israel. The assault on Ain al-Assad air base was the first time in months that American troops in Iraq have been wounded.

The US is engaged in intense diplomacy with a message for all parties to refrain from escalation and take steps to ease tensions.

Elon Musk's X is suing a marketing trade body, brands including Unilever and Mars, and US pharmacy chain CVS Health for an "illegal boycott" that it claims violates antitrust law. The lawsuit comes after the Republican-led House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary released a report alleging collusion by Garm and its members to limit consumer choice in breach of antitrust laws. X's CEO Linda Yaccarino said the company had lost billions due to the boycott, which she claimed undermined the marketplace of ideas and hurt users.

Two former Wirecard executives, Alexander von Knoop and Susanne Steidl, have been charged with breach of trust in connection with the company's collapse into insolvency in 2020. Prosecutors accuse them of approving over €100mn in potentially fraudulent loans to sham companies controlled by a business partner of former chief operating officer Jan Marsalek. The charges carry prison terms of up to 15 years if found guilty. Wirecard's collapse was one of Europe's largest accounting scandals, with the company having a market capitalization of €24bn at its peak.

The UK government's disinformation unit has been compiling examples of posts on X that are deemed a threat to national security, but the platform has been less responsive in taking them down. Elon Musk has launched incendiary attacks on Sir Keir Starmer's government over its handling of far-right protests. Despite calls from officials, X has kept concerning content up, including posts accusing Starmer of prioritizing Muslims and minorities. The UK government is pushing for stricter regulations on online social media platforms to prevent the spread of misinformation and incitement towards violence **[Online Safety Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-online-safety-bill)**.
