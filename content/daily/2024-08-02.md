# Market Turmoil: Interest Rates, Inflation, and Investor Sentiment
As investors navigate the complex web of global economic trends, recent developments have shed light on the intricate relationships between interest rates, inflation, and market sentiment.

## Japanese Stocks Plummet Amidst Strengthening Yen
Japanese stocks took a hit as the yen continued its surge against the dollar, reaching ¥148.56 during early Thursday trading. The Topix index fell as much as 3.6%, with carmakers and manufacturers bearing the brunt of the losses. Toyota, Panasonic, and Japan's biggest banks were among the hardest-hit companies. According to Bank of Singapore's chief economist Mansoor Mohi-uddin, "You have now got uncertainty in the market about the BoJ's reaction function and about the pace of future rate hikes."

## Amazon's Spending Spree: A Sign of Things to Come?
Amazon's latest quarterly results revealed a surge in capital spending, with most of it funnelled into cloud infrastructure. The company's chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky noted that customer demand for Amazon's AI services was "amplifying" cloud sales. However, the increased spending has raised concerns among investors, who are looking for evidence that the massive investments being poured into AI technology and infrastructure are starting to pay off.

## Investors Bet on BoE Rate Cut Amidst Global Economic Slowdown
Investors are increasingly betting on a rate cut by the Bank of England this week, as signs of slowing growth and inflation in the eurozone and the US have spurred bets that the British economy is likely to follow a similar trajectory. According to Ranjiv Mann, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, "Market expectations for a rate cut have been ticking up... there's been underwhelming data from Europe and that has tipped the balance in favour of a BoE rate cut this week."

Evan Gershkovich, a 32-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter, has been released from a Russian prison after over a year of detention. He was arrested in March last year on espionage charges, which the US government and his employer dismissed as baseless. In a prisoner swap involving seven countries, Russia freed 16 people, including prominent dissident Ilya Yashin and Washington Post columnist Vladimir Kara-Murza. Gershkovich was greeted by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.

Kamala Harris's presidential campaign has gained momentum among top lawyers in the US, with some prominent law firms pledging support. An email from Brad Karp, chair of Paul Weiss, rallied nearly 300 lawyers to back Harris, generating an enthusiastic response. The push for Harris comes as her campaign breaks fundraising records and gains business support. Key figures like Faiza Saeed (Cravath) and Doug Jones (former senator) are involved in the efforts. A large event is expected to raise up to $10mn this autumn. **Big Law** has rallied around Harris, with many firms represented among her supporters.

Southern Spain's Valencia region is cracking down on Airbnb-style holiday rentals due to a rising backlash against mass tourism. The regional government aims to stamp out black-market rentals with fines of up to €600,000. Officials want to regulate and bring order to holiday apartments that have grown in an uncontrolled way. With 106,000 licensed apartments and an estimated 50,000 unregistered black market ones, the region plans to enlist municipal governments to boost enforcement and harmonize EU laws on short-term rentals. **#Airbnb #HolidayRentals #Tourism**

Intel's shares fell 20% after the company announced plans to cut 15,000 jobs, or about 15% of its workforce, due to financial struggles. The cuts aim to shore up Intel's weakening finances and put its business back on a stable footing. The company also scrapped its dividend and reduced capital spending by 20%, sparking concerns on Wall Street that Intel is losing ground to rivals AMD and Nvidia. Revenue fell 1% in the second quarter, and Intel expects a pro forma loss of 3 cents a share in the third quarter.

Former CNN anchor Don Lemon has sued Elon Musk and X over a cancelled show deal. In January, Lemon was offered a one-year exclusive partnership with X for $1.5mn, plus 60% of ad revenue and additional cash incentives. However, the deal was cancelled after Lemon recorded an interview with Musk, which asked personal questions about ketamine use. Musk claimed the show "lacked authenticity" and was "CNN on social media." Lemon's lawsuit alleges fraud, breach of contract, and misappropriation of his name and likeness.

The EU has told Hungary and Slovakia to stop relying on Russian oil, citing alternative sources are available. The two countries had complained that Ukraine was blocking supplies from Russia via the Druzhba pipeline. However, the commission said the overall flow of crude had not diminished, and they could use an existing pipeline bringing shipborne crude from Croatia. The move comes as Hungary and Slovakia face criticism over their stance on arming Ukraine and relations between them and Brussels have worsened recently. **EU**, **Hungary**, **Slovakia**, **Russian oil**

Apple's revenue rose 5% in the three months ending June, driven by a strong services business and iPad sales, which offset declining iPhone sales and a continued slowdown in China. Total net sales reached $85.8bn, beating analysts' expectations. The company's services segment grew to $24.2bn, while iPad sales jumped 24% to $7.2bn. Apple is bullish on upgrading customers gaining access to new AI features. Research and development expenses rose 8% to $8bn, with efforts significantly increased on AI over the course of the year.

Apollo Global Management's profits have taken a hit due to derivative trades entered to hedge interest rate risk. The firm paid up to $230mn per year on interest rate swaps but has yet to generate returns. This cost is weighing on current and future earnings, with the hedges expected to lop off about 5% of profit growth in spread-related earnings. Apollo's chief executive noted that the disagreement over US rate policy provided opportunities for additional hedging, which "cost us growth" for the quarter and will do so in the third quarter as well.

IAG, the owner of British Airways and other airlines, reports strong profits and a decision to pay a dividend for the first time since the pandemic. The company's chief executive Luis Gallego attributes the success to "continuing strong demand" in core markets. However, IAG has given up on its attempt to acquire Spain's Air Europa after failing to convince EU regulators that the deal would not harm competition. Despite this setback, IAG's profits beat forecasts and it will pay an interim dividend of 30 cents a share **[IAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Airlines_Group)**.

Gunvor, a Swiss commodity trader, is stepping up its bet on biofuels by acquiring half of Varo Energy's $600mn Dutch biofuel project. The move comes despite lower than expected growth in demand for the product. Gunvor will share costs with Varo to develop a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel plant at Rotterdam port, which is expected to meet 7% of EU's mandated SAF demand by 2030. This investment is part of Gunvor's diversification strategy after record profits in the past two years. **Biofuels** and **sustainable energy** are highlighted keywords.

The media industry is seeking a new profit model with AI, after learning from their experience with online gatekeepers like Google and Facebook. Recent deals between companies like Perplexity and publishers such as Automattic and Der Spiegel show they are acting early to control their content. These agreements aim to share revenue tied directly to results that depend on the publisher's content, establishing an economic model that can be promoted more widely. However, the bargaining power of publishers is uncertain, and they may struggle to extract value from AI-generated content.

French insurer Axa has entered exclusive talks with BNP Paribas to sell its investment management arm for €5.1bn. The deal would create one of the largest industry players in Europe, with a business within the French bank managing €1.5tn in assets. BNP's asset management business would gain "critical size" in public and alternative assets. Axa will receive cash proceeds of €5.1bn, plus €0.3bn for the linked sale of Select, an Axa unit providing fund services. The disposal is expected to result in a €2.2bn one-off net income gain for Axa.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has defended its decision to allow two boxers, Imane Khelif (Algeria) and Lin Yu-ting (Taiwan), to compete in the women's welterweight and featherweight categories at the Paris Olympics. The duo was previously disqualified from the world championships for not meeting gender eligibility requirements. However, the IOC claims they were "victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision" by the International Boxing Association (IBA). The decision has drawn criticism from Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who questioned the fairness of the competition.

Israel has confirmed that it killed Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif in an air strike in Gaza last month. Deif, one of the masterminds of the October 7 attack, was targeted along with other top officials in a series of strikes on Khan Younis. The Israeli defense minister said Deif's death reflects Hamas' disintegration and that terrorists may surrender or be eliminated. The strike came amid soaring tensions after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader in Tehran, and a senior commander of Hezbollah. *Israel* *Hamas*

Hizbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the battle between his group and Israel has entered a new phase after the killing of a senior commander in Beirut. Nasrallah vowed a "certain" response to Israel's actions, warning that they had breached limits. The escalation comes amid tensions over the death of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran. Iran and its allies are expected to retaliate, with Nasrallah hinting that other militias may join in. Diplomats are racing to prevent a wider regional conflict.

**Key Entities:**

* Hizbollah
* Israel
* Hassan Nasrallah
* Ismail Haniyeh
